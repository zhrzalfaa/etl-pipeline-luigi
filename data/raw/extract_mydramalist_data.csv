Goblin has just made my favorites list. Even my husband got sucked in and loves this show. The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was amazing, the actors were perfect (Hello, Gong Yoo!), the story was heartbreakingly beautiful.   This is the first time I've watched any of the main actors except Yoo In Na. I have now officially developed a Gong Yoo crush and understand why drama fans are enamored of him.  Gong Yoo as Kim Shin/ Goblin was mesmerizing. I could listen to his voice for days. Every scene he was in was a treat. Every emotion that his character had was palpable, and his smiles could light up the sky.  And Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak was super cute. She had a lot of detractors and the writer got a lot of flak for making her so young. But the character and her age were perfect for this story and how it unfolded. Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper had the perfect deadpan (heh) delivery. And he may be the best male ""crier"" I've seen yet.   The story will make you laugh and make you cry. Not only is the love story epic, but so is the bromance between Goblin and Reaper. I've found that I'm quite fond of this fantasy genre and this has been done so well. I have hardly any criticisms of this show at all because even the flaws faded into nothing noticeable for me. It's sweet, funny, romantic, sad, tragic, beautiful...  The music was perfect and perfectly lovely. I don't always pay much attention to the music, but this show utilized it so well and chose the perfect songs. So many people loved even the intro song that they made a special recording of it to make it a full length song (Round and Round, but may also be found under Never Far Away). Beautiful by Crush was the best song in my opinion, and I believe that it was the theme song for our main couple. And Stay With Me by Chanyeol and Punch was another favorite.  Rewatch value is high - if not everything, then there are many, many favorite scenes that I'll go back to and relive the feels. :)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"AnanyaS","/profile/Tanya94","Jan 21, 2017","204","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Every moment of it indeed shined! Goblin is a great drama. I went into it with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised, or more accurately,  I was blown away. You can recognize a good drama by the way it makes you feel exactly what the characters in the drama are feeling. That's the way Goblin was for me, with each character, I laughed and I cried.   I'll TRY to keep the review sweet and short, so here are the reasons I enjoyed Goblin: -The premise is unique. It's one of a kind. I haven't seen any other Kdramas with a similar plot-line to Goblin, so that was a plus point. -The actors do a superb job. I could feel their emotions from across the screen. then again, nothing less to be expected from such a spectacular cast. -The drama has everything, ranging from bromance, romance to mystery and suspense. -The bromance is spectacular. One of the most epic bromance I've ever seen in a Kdrama. It made me laugh a lot, but it also had its heartwarming and heart-wrenching moments. Goblin and Grim Reaper's relationship is one of the best reasons to pick this up. -The two couples- Goblin & Eun Tak and Grim Reaper & Sunny. Both couples had their own story. The sweet and cute moments of the Goblin couple & the sizzling chemistry between Grim Reaper and Sunny was enough to keep the 'romance' meter of the drama pretty high. You won't be able to get enough of the cuteness of Goblin & Eun Tak. -The mystery of the characters. From 'the lady in red' to the king and queen, each episode just gave enough glimpse into their lives to keep us engrossed. It'll drive you crazy in a good way. -Each minute of every episode was enjoyable. I didn't skip a single moment of any episode. -The unexpectedness of the drama was really great. Just when you'd think you had something figured out, some twist would come along and surprise you. The writer sure did a tremendous job. BONUS: Beautiful and addictive OST  I personally didn't find anything even remotely bad about it, but that's not to say other people won't, so here's a few things you should keep in mind before venturing into it. -The age difference between Goblin [ (~939) he was 39 when he died and then immortal for 900 years] and Eun Tak (19). -Comparatively less screen time for Sunny and Grim Reaper couple. But I suppose that's to be expected specially since the title alone indicates that Kim Shin (Goblin) is the main lead, so it's no wonder they get the most screen time. -Worst product placement you'll ever see in a Kdrama. You might think I'm kidding but sometimes even the smallest thing can annoy you. I personally found those scenes amusing though.  So, to sum up- I LOVED this drama! Do give this one a chance, you won't be disappointed. Once you start it, chances are, you'll end up loving it. Happy Watching!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"dragynfaerie","/profile/dragynfaerie","Jan 23, 2017","416","6.5","Overall 6.5    Story 6.5 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 8.0 Rewatch Value 1.5    Overrated  I feel compelled to write a review for Goblin because I'm finding all the perfect 10s to be misleading and, if I can be honest, completely confounding. Let me first say the best thing about Goblin is the acting. The cast is fantastic. The worst is the age gap. I know most people talk about the age of the actors; however, the issue to those of us that have a problem with the age isn't the actors, it's the characters.  The lead female character is a 19 year old girl. The lead male (taking out the fantasy of his living 938 years) is a grown man who appears almost 40. Personally, I find that the Korean's have been dancing too close to the line in the young girls with adult men in dramas for at least a year now and I'm not a fan. They're more daddy issue characters. There are many times when the  relationship between the 2 leads are most like Father & daughter. She speaks to him like a father figure. And he speaks to her as a child. It's off putting when it becomes clear that he has fallen for this high school girl. Part of me believes the part of Kim Shin (the Goblin) was written for a younger man. Considering the life expectancy of the period and his postion, in his late 30s he should have had a wife (and concubines I would guess) and children. I think the character should have been at least 10 years younger (again the 900 years undead aside).  The romance of the leads just did not work for me on any level. Conversely, the romance between the supports is a completely different story. It was endearing and very moving. I rooted for them. The writing was inconsistent.  It was great in some parts and just passable in others. Toward the end it almost turned into melodramatic schlock.  Goblin works best as a bromance.  The scenes between Goblin, Reaper(s), and the male humans were precious golden nuggets to hold onto until the next time 2 or 3 of them were in a scene together.  Had the writers held on to that chemistry and nourished it, Goblin would have been much better.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"BrightestStar","/profile/Mrmz","Jan 27, 2017","146","6.5","Overall 6.5    Story 6.0 Acting/Cast 8.5 Music 10 Rewatch Value 5.0      I was going to give it a 7 but there were too many things that bothered me, too many plot holes.  I enjoyed watching this drama more times than not. It was relaxing to look at, with the great cinematography and breathtaking sceneries. Music was great and very fitting. The actors were more or less very fitting in their roles and felt natural. The chemistry between the male cast was flawless.  I guess my main and only issue here is the writing. There are two types of supernatural dramas: the one that explores human emotions through the supernatural; and the ones that use it to tell your usual story. I think Goblin was somewhere in between.  I still appreciate some points of the writing. What I dislike is the plot as a whole. I liked the overall idea but not the execution. I like the idea of supernatural and powerful beings, like ghosts, goblins, grim reapers and gods, are living normally among humans without being noticed. I liked the story of the little boy we meet early in the drama to see his fate and effect on the Goblin (and vice versa). I loved the heartfelt story of Eun Tak's ghost friend, and enjoyed the company of the group of Ahjuma ghosts.   What I greatly disliked is the way the main story arc was handled. At first it felt overly dramatic, but later it felt so underwhelming that it removes and intensity felt before. When it ended the way it did, I felt there was no point to the whole story. Essentially were back to point zero.  I think the writer has some original ideas, but no guts to go deeper. As a result interesting topics were touched lightly, but never went beyond, hence felt shallow. I wish more time was spend in exploring the world, getting more concrete information on how demons are created and how to deal with them. Instead you just follow the characters' daily life of not doing much, and supernatural elements were just used as a convenience.   When it comes to romance, I didn't care much about the age difference due to the supernatural part of it, but I just didn't enjoy it, I didn't feel it. I don't know when it happened. Also Goblin was beyond childish. He was too moody and unbearable at times. While I was more invested into the secondary couple, I still felt the same, as in a missing episode of them going out and truly falling in love with each other was missing. I didn't like the way both couples went.  The non-romance relationships were great. The bromance, there was more than plenty. It was perfect. The focus and the growing relationship felt authentic and real. I also loved the relationship between Grim Reaper and Eun Tak. I did enjoy Deok Hwa's presence, but man was he so underused!   Other things that bothered me but not necessarily cause any deduction to the rating is over the top product placement. At one point it looked like subway was about to save the world, one sandwich at a time. And the wardrobe of poor little female lead, I just wonder how she manages to fit all those clothes in such little luggages and how she can afford them. I love how they presented Quebec at first, but I got mad that they didn't try to be accurate as to how the city looked at this time of the year. Worst of all is the episode length. It was needlessly long.  I don't regret watching this drama. I still had a great time watching. Although the last three episodes felt too draggy and less enjoyable, but it still had some good moments. Well all moments with GR for me are great lol. Enjoy! And don't hate me too much for the rating :P  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

"PickyMcpickleton","/profile/Ghettoe","Jan 23, 2017","252","6.5","Overall 6.5    Story 6.5 Acting/Cast 6.0 Music 7.0 Rewatch Value 1.0      It must be said that Goblin is very much a somewhat cliché rom-com disguising itself as something else, but ultimately, what appears to be an interesting premise is cast aside for a romantic plot that I'm going to be honest is a little creepy and at times feels very fatherly to me. This makes it very hard to love the romance especially when the female lead is a bubble of cutesy energy and also she borderline looks twelve. There were moments I wanted to run into the scene and tell Gong Yoo, you get the hell away from her and date someone your own age. Yes, that, 782 age gap was at times hard to swallow.  What makes Goblin good is it's featuring. It stars longing looks, teary-eyed longing looks, bromance, ignoring that he is 800 years old, trying to pretend you are not watching this because of the bromance and good looking leads and KES's obligatory three good episodes towards the end that makes you think this is so good. It also stars a very good performance by Lee Dong Wook. I'd like to say the rest of the cast were just as good, but I'd be lying. Gong Yoo is someone, I watch because he is in good movies (The Crucible/Silenced, etc) but not because he gives an actual good performance. He's like a Brad Pitt type in that regard. I was quite surprised by LDW as I find him heavily attractive and have for a long time but I've admitted he's a terrible actor. Suddenly he is Matthew McConaughaying me. The female lead is literally a copy paste of all rom-coms. Especially from this writer.  The intro of this drama is unique and creates what has the potential to be a very good plot, but ultimately this is a meandering slow stream of a journey that I heavily recommend you skip some episodes. Yes, skip from ep 5 to 13 and you'll miss very little. The juicy parts of the plot are thrown aside for a slew of teary-eyed longing looks and cliché romantic scenes that at ep 4, I started to wonder when they were actually going to focus on the juicy premise.     Character wise, the bromance sells this stale plot as personally, the romance between the male and female lead just looks awkward. I should be gushing at romantic scenes but they look as uncomfortable as I do and when Gong Yoo pats her head, he at times feels like her father. The drama has a lot of potential but the writer didn't seem to know what to do with it and I feel like a traitor who deserves to be hanged for saying this, but as a huge lover of bromance, dare I say it, I actually got bored of the bromance. I started tuning in to cast longing looks at Lee Dong Wook. My obsession made me run out into the street and jump in front of a car, but I heavily recommend you don't do that as the Grim Reaper never appeared and now I'm writing this in the afterlife.   The writer here also inserts her I suckered you into thinking this was good by having her obligatory three good episodes that make me think, Oh this has potential. It's always towards the end too. Melancholic episodes with good editing that make me wonder where was this for the previous ten episodes? I feel the drama is a seven at best as in, I would be very generous to give it a 7. It has its good melancholic and humorous scenes but it ultimately never quite gets its pacing right and never seems to know what to focus on making this really not as good as it could be.  PS. I also urge you to cast aside any logical questions you might have especially towards the end. They will not be answered.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"wonhwa","/profile/wonhwa","Feb 13, 2017","147","6.0","Overall 6.0    Story 6.0 Acting/Cast 8.0 Music 8.0 Rewatch Value 3.0    This review may contain spoilers   Somewhere inside Goblin, buried under a mound of PPL and tears, is a good show trying to get out. The first two episodes suggest what might have been, deftly mixing intense action and off-beat humor in a dark world filled with ominous reapers, wounded goblins, ghost-seeing teenagers and cabbage-wielding grannies. The stage seems set for a life and death clash of epic proportions. Alas, it soon becomes apparent that the writer forgot to include an antagonist. The goblin-reaper face-off devolves into a chummy bromance, leaving “fate” to play the role of spoiler. Unfortunately, it’s hard to fight disembodied destiny. Whole episodes are spent weeping in pretty scenery and eating Subway sandwiches. The talented cast tries to up the urgency, but with nothing tangible to battle, the pacing slows to a crawl. The extended episode lengths and the director’s tendency to linger a little too long on every moment exacerbate the problem. Even the romance falters on the uncomfortable age gap between the protagonists.  Every so often. interesting ideas pop up about guilt, redemption, and the role of kindness in a cosmos more random than rewarding. Alas, the fickle gods that rule this universe stay above the fray. A drama that actually allowed its characters to take them on rather than simply lamenting their cruelty could have been powerful indeed.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Erin","/profile/erinfgill","Feb 21, 2017","39","6.5","Overall 6.5    Story 6.0 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 8.0 Rewatch Value 3.0      This drama is extremely overrated. It's boring. From the premise, it seems original, but its just a generic k-drama romance full of cliches. The main girl is extremely immature and I find the age gap quite worrying. I did not find her too annoying as some people have said, she could be the kind of girl found in high school (still though her immaturity is exaggerated). It is the relationship between her character and the Goblin I disliked- it just didn't work. The romance does not feel real or believable. It feels like a father and daughter, but we are supposed to believe they are in love. It seemed like I would especially enjoy it because of the historical/fantasy aspects, which are genres I love, but these are only very small parts of the drama. Although I did expect these to be only small parts, I didn't enjoy the rest of the drama anyway. I found myself wanting to skip lots or sometimes felt like I was falling asleep. The plot skips ahead often and feels a bit all over the place, as if the writers didn't really know what they were doing. I constantly found myself frustrated and bored with the story. In saying that I loved the parts involving the Grim Reaper, and his relationship with the Goblin and Sunny, and when the fantasy/historical elements did appear I enjoyed them. The acting was also very good. However, overall I did not enjoy this drama and would not recommend it unless you like watching generic, boring romances with poor writing (or watch it and skip all of the main romance- lmao).

"Ivana","/profile/Ive","Mar 10, 2017","94","3.0","Overall 3.0    Story 3.0 Acting/Cast 8.5 Music 9.0 Rewatch Value 1.0      The most overrated drama ...  (pls read the whole review)    The female lead made me cringe.  there were moments that had to make her look mature but failed... The writers probably wanted her seem like strong person- bullied and neglected by a lot of people, but even with such a hard life she keeps being super kind and joyfull, tries her best in school and ect... ok, that is good... but the writer forgot about her behavior. They trully over did it. She acted like a 8 year old girl, she way too cozy in a strangers house . I dont know if the actress (she is good) is in the wrong or the writers. I really tried to force myself to watch this till the very end ... Maybe the drama should have been about the grim reaper, cause I always saw the goblin more as a father figure to the female lead. Its seems creepy and she doesnt help with acting kind of spoiled sometimes. The goblin legit acted like a creep sometime tho, how is that sweet or romantic? I hope that those that liked the drama wont feel bad if they read this~ XD   I just wanna add, that I have seen similar type of ""relationship"" in real life to the one in the drama. Thats why maybe I am a little triggered. He legit can get registered as an offender (done something or not), cause she is a minor in the start. So ya, think about that and other unwise things Eun Tak did though the drama. Then you will understand maybe why I kind of dislike it :(  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"alon-luna","/profile/alon-luna","Jun 24, 2018","21","7.0","Overall 7.0    Story 7.0 Acting/Cast 7.5 Music 6.0 Rewatch Value 6.0      So far, a lot of Korean dramas I've watched follow what I call the 90-10 rule. 90 percent of the plot will be a romantic comedy filled with light and fluffy moments while the other 10 percent will be focused on the theme that gives the drama its identity.  Goblin follows this rule to a tee where most of the story involves the characters acting funny or cute with each other. The rest involves dealing with their lives as supernatural beings, coupled with occasional flashbacks of a previous life hundreds of years ago.I'm not sure if I can call this a flaw. I know a lot of viewers love this sort of thing and there's nothing wrong with preferring the lighthearted and none-too-heavy in terms of plot. I know it can be a great stress reliever as well. I prefer my dramas more on the plot heavy side though; even the most romantic stories I like have about '50 percent of something-else-going-on-other-than-the-romance.' But for what it's worth, Goblin is extremely successful as a rom-com. I just happen to be more interested in the supernatural or dramatic parts of it. For me, the most interesting scenes where when Eun Tak had to deal with the ghosts she could see, when Grim Reaper had to transport the dead one drama at a time and when a deity or god would pop up in the story to mess with the characters. Overall, Goblin was an adorable little show but it could have been much bigger.I loved the world that it introduced me to. A world where Grim Reapers would meet and convene on their deadly assignments, where Goblins could make gold out of nothing and where special people (like Eun Tak) could help the dead get over their unfinished business. I wish there could have been more of that.  Was the Goblin (the main character) the only Goblin in the world? Were there others like him? There were moments where I wanted to see more of what made a Goblin special (and how they were able to tie this Korean fantasy creature to a modern day adaptation) and what he could do to make people's lives more magical.  While his telekinetic fight scenes with Reaper were adorable, I kind of wished to see his powers put to better use. I wanted his 'Goblin persona' to make the story more interesting.  This drama offers a tantalizing glimpse of a supernatural world in the modern age but there is so very little of it :(Now the chemistry between the OTP was fine. I felt that they had their best moments in the last two episodes (where the drama really made it worthwhile and where I finally got the Gong Yu hype!) but the earlier episodes (all 14 to be exact) were somewhat boring for me because the development of their relationship consisted mostly of:Goblin:  'Oh can she see the sword in my chest?', 'Will she pull it out?' 'Oh, I need her to get it out of me', 'Oh, I don't want her to pull it out now!'Eun Tak; 'Am I the Goblin's Bride?' 'Oh, I won't pull the sword out for some reason' 'Oh, I want to pull it out but he won't let me', 'Oh, now I know what will happen if it gets pulled out I'm never going to do it- how could he ask me to!'That's basically what their relationship dynamic was like for most of the show.  I much preferred Grim Reaper and Sunny's dynamic because it touched on the difficulties of a Reaper/human relationship better. The Reaper's past was also more intriguing because it explained why he was doomed to such a fate. In the Goblin's (aka Kim Shin) case, the immortal life he was given was meant to be a reward but it played out more like a punishment. This made no sense to me because in the very first* episode, his past life as a noble warlord was established. He was betrayed, he committed no crime whatsoever...so every time the gods would make things difficult for him...every time the story would make him suffer...these consequences didn't really fit in with the logic of reward-punishment the story was trying to make. The character was blameless so the suffering he went through had no basis and felt hollow to me.Other Things I Took Note Off:Gong Yu wasn't the best actor but his charisma as a leading man was appealing. I didn't get it until the very last episodes (this is where the romantic angle finally worked out for me and the OTP moments became squee worthy); I just wish it happened sooner ;0I liked the actress playing Eun Tak. But the problem I had was that the director told her to act too childlike. I get that the whole 'naive and innocent' candy girl is a staple in these dramas...but her version was too exaggerated and went way beyond the trope. I've watched (and appreciated) plenty of other candy girls before but Eun Tak was a little too much for me at times. She was a 19/20 year old woman and she played it like she was 13, squealing over a bag she got as a present, jumping up and down the bed and hugging her stuffed toys, crying in the bed while it rained outside...the last time I saw this peculiar behavior was in the Hollywood action movie Taken, where Liam Neeson's daughter ""Kimmy"" acted like a 7 year old kid instead of as a teenager/young woman.  In hindsight, perhaps it was a good thing that the OTP moments came at the later episodes, as it was only then that Eun Tak started acting normally -_- Lee Dong Wok may be the best actor here. He was definitely the best crier. He brought so much depth to the flawed but intriguing Reaper, who easily became my favorite character. The way he expressed emotions seemed extremely heartfelt. Now, I don't have that much familiarity with Yoo In Na; the only other time I've seen her was in My Love From the Stars where she played a similar supporting character. But her Sunny is very likable -the no-nonsense types female leads usually are.One thing Goblin excels in is that it had some of the best special effects I've seen in any drama. Viewers can feast their eyes on some of the most beautiful landscapes abroad and in Korea. The fight scenes, exploding cars, etc., all were great to look at. The historical parts were done well, too.The OST is nice to hear but like plenty of other Korean dramas, when you pause to really listen to the English parts in the lyrics- they don't make much sense. ""Never go my way...never quite some day..."" what?! XD Overall, Goblin was a good show but it wasn't great. I think viewers who don't mind extremely light (as in, 'hardly nothing ever happens but we are all so cute anyway!') plots would appreciate this the most. I'm glad I watched this; I feel like I can understand the hype more although I can't participate in it as much as I would like. Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Please don't hate me!  Yes the actors are good, the cinematography is great and the music also. There is clearly a big budget and the special effects are awesome fo a tv drama.  But despite all of that, even if the main plot is interesting, the rythme is extremely slow and all of each episodes are flashback scenes over and over again. I found myself nearly sleeping while watching this.  And I do not like the main couple (the 2nd one is really touching on the other hand). Why? Well in my opinion the age cap is too much (not the actors but the characters in the way they are written), she is speaking to Gong Yoo like he is her father and she is acting really like a teenager, I found this disturbing.  Conclusion, yes it is a good drama but for me the lack of action and the slowness of it is not compensated by the rest of the positive points.

Unfortunately it turned out to be a great disappointment. There is not much depth to the story and to be honest I didn’t care much for any of the characters. For a man who has lived for 900+ years, Kim Shin has about as much maturity as a 16 year old boy. Moreover, the lead pair is terribly mismatched. A younger looking actor might’ve been better suited. If this were real life, I would go so far as to think that Ji Eun Tak was a vulnerable girl who loves goblin only because he is someone that pays attention to her and takes care of her. Not exactly the best reasons to love someone.That said, not all is bad with the show. I enjoyed watching the second pair as well as Deok Hwa. I was never a fan of Yoo In Na in her previous work but I think she did a good job here. As did Lee Dong Wook and Sung Jae.Music was pleasant to listen to. I especially like “Stay with Me”.The best part of the show was the cinematography. Maybe I have a bit of a soft corner since Quebec is my home province. But I must say, they did a wonderful job shooting around the Chateau Frontenac and surroundings. The Goryeo scenes were good too.Rewatch value is none since the first watch was painful enough. For such thin plot line, what was the need to have 1.5 hour episodes? Tighter editing or fewer episodes might have made the show a bit more bearable.Watch if you’re curious like I was, because of the hype. But I would not recommend it.

I have 0 patience with this kind of girl. Matrealistic, selfish and demanding. All of characteristics that I don't like. The bromance is sweet and funny so it has saved the story in general. Some scenes are still questionable, even the male lead character changed so abruptly from a great war general to a silly childish guy after meeting a teenage girl for a few days.  The beginning of the plot is so slow with so many flashbacks and unnecessary scenes. Second lead female is redundant (which is a pity) from eps 1-10, like she got so little scenes in the drama besides those flashbacks and sitting in the empty shop. I would say this drama will be very good if its only about  6 - 8 episodes. There are too many fillers in the drama (which is understandable) probably to get more money from advertisements to cover big budget.   Music ????  Music is good. I admit it. I like all the songs in  this drama. It's very catchy and refreshing.   Cinematography It is good. Editing team is expert in this. It has cinematography like movie. The color is solid, the background, houses, shooting venue, fashion style, everything is nice. I can tell that it has a big production budget.   Acting is okay. I can relate. It's not making me feel weird. Just some characters written by the writer that makes me feel strange.   Overall, i know this is a good drama, i mean most of the aspects are good. But sadly, i appreciate movie and drama based on the story and character development. Since the story is not good enough for me, the drama has big flaw in my eyes. Sorry, i  had higher expectation after i watched 1st episode that i became so disappointed with the rest of the episodes. Especially the middle ones.   But i would recommend this drama for u to watch if u don't mind of the strange romance that feels forceful for me, this is a drama for u.  ohh i need to mention it again, i hate the female lead character, ok.

I love seeing how different creatures live and how they use their powers (if they have any)in our everyday life etc. but to me, this drama doesn't live up to its hype.  I think the acting, the senaries, the music and the overall plot is great, but i feel like this drama is very dragged. There's a lot of repetitive scenes and other unnecessary scenes where i find myself being so bored that i almost fall asleep, at one point i actually fell asleep watching this drama. I usually like dramas that are more on the shorter side and although this drama is 16 (or technically 16,5) episodes long, each episode is around 1 hour and 20 minutes and i'm sorry for saying this, but that is toooo long. The thing is, the episodes are just very unnecessarily long. They could've easily told the same story in 16 episodes where each episode were 1 hour long, without all the unnecessary scenes. If they had done that, i think this drama would've been right up my alley, but unfortunately they didn't.  I'll probably finish this drama at some point soon (i'm currently on episode 13, it's taking me a long time to watch this) but i can already tell that it's not a drama i'll rewatch.

The cinematography is LOVE LOVE LOVE. I want to go visit Canada now. 2. The bromance. 3. Grim Reaper's deadpan sense of humor. So my thing. 4. Gong Yoo has never looked hotter. (Okay, that's not quite true. He's ALWAYS hot.) 5. Goblin's pettiness. 6. Sunny's character. I like her lots.  What I disliked about it: 1. TOO. DAMN. LONG. Too many scenes linger on unnecessary beats and they stretch scenes that aren't at all integral to the plot. The premise had so much promise but it wasn't used to its full potential. 2. Kim Go-eun's cutesy act. I like her as an actress and she's fab in the dramatic scenes but she tends to overdo the aegyo. It doesn't help that her character is...confusing. She's supposed to be intelligent and quite mature, and the next she does absolutely imbecilic things. SMH. 3. I didn't quite buy the romance between the millenia-old dokkaebi and his high schooler bride. 4. That ending. I'm ambivalent about it.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

But just because I enjoyed it at some points or I cried doesn't mean I can't be critical of it. First things first, the female lead was such a generic female character in a romantic film/show. We've seen her a hundred times over, please get rid of this overused rom com dynamic. Her selfishness and her absolute self importance made me continuously pissed off during the entire show. Second. Let us never overlook the age gap. From the second the 2 leads met I automatically assumed we would watch her grow up and have the romance at a more reasonable age. But that didn't happen. We got a very creepy romance between a man in his 40's (900's) and a 19 year old girl. Her absolute infatuation with him was impossible to get past. How she begged to marry him and demanded love from such an older man made my guts twist.Truly the show would have been better with the secondary couple as the main. Sunny and Grim Reaper were a more believable pair and ultimately a more tragic story. Sunny was a much better female character. More interesting and overall kept me watching to see it to the end. The bromance was funny at times and as separate moments they were good but in the context of the scenes they seemed really random and misplaced.Overall very melodramatic and inconsistent. Inconsistent writing, characters and pacing. It definitely wasn't terrible and certain moments had me go back to rewatch because there were really good individual moments but in the end it seems to be a very cheesy and overhyped due to the handsome actors.But that's just my opinion Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I was under the impression it could easily be a ""staple"" drama that you need to watch if you wanna be ""in the know"" about all the good K-dramas out there. Sadly, this is far from the truth.Starting with the good (because the amount of 'bad' is far greater) - the PREMISE of the story is very, very good. The set-up had a lot of potential, and you can see pieces of a good storyline scattered throughout the badly-executed series. I found myself wanting to know more about how life and death worked in this universe, about the mysteries of the world and the mysteries of the characters' pasts. The framework is there, very solidly - it's just a shame they didn't put it to good use.I will also say, the character dynamics (save for the negatives which I will mention in a moment) can be very heartwarming and funny, and the casting certainly wasn't bad.But now we move to the bad.To begin - I know most people mention the age gap, but if I am to be honest, the ages themselves would've been somewhat forgivable if it weren't for the writing making that gap seem even larger. She addresses him as ""mister"" (or ""ahjussi"") throughout the series, she never stands up to him no matter how he treats her (feeling similar to a daughter respecting her father), and while she's giggling and wrinkling her nose and running around like an innocent child, he's either standing by like an obligatory parental guardian who's watching over an excited kid - or he's admiring her innocence, which on its own isn't bad, but when compounded with everything else becomes creepy. Their relationship feels much more father-daughter than romantic.And something I'm not hearing many people talk about - for a good while, their relationship begins as something very unhealthy. He's selfish, he treats her with disrespect, and she lets him do so. At first it felt like something that would go away - but instead, they just eventually get cuter out of the blue. It's like the writer wanted to write some kind of ""slowly developing relationship"" thing - but it didn't work out, and instead it's just hard to watch and a little confusing. I wasn't able to root for them for a majority of the series.On the other hand, the supporting roles have a MUCH better, deeper relationship, and they themselves are deeper characters. In fact, the side characters themselves are more interesting in general. They undergo more character development throughout the series and have a lot more depth than the main characters do - and one character who should have played a more important role, certainly never did.The list of ""negatives"" does keep going: The pacing becomes extremely slow after the first five-or-so episodes, there are many inconsistencies (some very blatant especially toward the end), important plot points end up feeling unimportant, there are unanswered questions that probably should've been answered, there's a point where a character makes such an obviously bad choice that it's practically unbelievable, and in spite of being 900, the Goblin tends to feel more dense than a 20-year-old. (Seriously, at the age of 900 can't he at LEAST be given the intelligence of an 80-year-old?)... and I can go on. In detail.I wanted this to be good. It has SUCH an interesting setup, but it just isn't. Even if half of these flaws didn't exist - with slow pacing and a semi-repetitive nature, it still gets very bland. When you root for the side characters and stop caring about the main characters, I'd say that's when a drama has ultimately failed.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The story was full of plot holes, and in a conversation I had, no one could explain the plot holes, and said I should just enjoy it for what it is. But how am I suppose to enjoy a drama that could have explain everything in 3 episodes but dragged out?This is a drama that stirs up my intellect more than anything else.The music for this drama was kind of blah, with all the hype, I thought they would have more than 1 piece I like. For majority dramas I watch, the music would be so good that I would replay the parts with the music I like, but for this drama I only like 1 song they had, and it wasn't good enough for a replayThe main couple were awkward and boring, maybe for people who likes extremely slow dramas. The chemistry between them is a little and awkward, like a woman falling in love with a stalker because she has psychological problems which hasn't been solved, and will love anyone who gives them any kind of attention. Or like a man who needs a needy woman to feel better about himself. Within a few episodes in, I could already predict the majority of the story line for the main couple.Overall, their relationship can be summarize by a daughter-father relationship with romance.The only redeeming thing about this drama is the supporting characters, they had a lot more chemistry, and their story line is more interesting with unpredictable outcome.I would never re-watch this drama for the main couple, maybe for the side couple but probably not.I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this, but if someone really wants to, than skip the parts with the main couple, their relationship is really repetitive and can be explain by a girl having a daddy problem, while the man having relationship problems with women.The most disappointing drama i watch in 2017, way over hyped. I think people who enjoy this probably just enjoy watching a dramatic fantasy romance and not like me, who tend to overthink and find plot holes.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

It was said to be such a great drama. It took me really long to watch it, simply because I am an anti-hype girl. I never read or watch things while they are being hyped, as I don't want my view to be somehow clouded.But then at some point, I'll probably watch or read it nevertheless. That's how it was with Goblin. And I honestly looked forward to it because it was supposed to be such a great drama. Boy, was I wrong. Here's why.Story:The story is basically a great idea! A Goblin who needs his bride to be redeemed. His bride being a High School girl, that he once saved, who sees ghosts. Wait, what?! An ancient guy and a High School girl? Oooooookay....I thought, well, maybe they just meet once while she's in High School and then they meet years later to fall in love. Well, no. That's not what happens. The story is reaaaaaaallllllyyyyyy slow paced and with that at some point it was just dragging on and on and on and on and I thought  ""MOVE! FORWARD!"" But that did not happen until the last two or so episodes. Meeh -.-  The only thing that made this slow story better is the story line between the Grim Reaper and Sunny. I would have loved to have THEM as the main couple and tell THEIR story rather than the Goblin's story.Acting/Cast:I haven't watched any drama with Gong Yoo or Lee Dong Wook before, wo I was open to anything that might come along the way. They both acted fantastically but I was just SO IRRITATED with Gong Yoo's role. He was constantly going on my nerves acting like a spoiled little child. Some scenes, especially in the beginning were really funny and I got some weird glances from my husband because I burst out in laughter several times. But after some time the Goblin became really annoying.The Grim Reaper on the other hand had a lot of depth and he was a fascinating character through and through.Now on to the girls, I watched Kim Go Eun in ""Cheese in the Trap"" and Yoo In Na in ""My love from another star"" and I liked both of them. Here they also did a pretty alright job. But due to this slow paced story I couldn't enjoy there acting much.A huge praise goes to Yook Sung Jae, he was hilarious and so damn cute!Also, I would have loved to see more scenes with Kim So Hyun and Kim Min Jae - THEY LOOK SO FREAKING GOOD TOGETHER! Can they please get a drama where they are the OTP!?!?Music:Now that's the amazing part of the drama - the music. Alsways spot on and so so beautiful! Together with the scenery - WOW!Rewatch Value:I would give a 0 if I could. Will never rewatch this.Overall:It could have been amazing! Unfortunately it wasn't. Not at all.

"WhiteLilly","/profile/alexarts","Jan 25, 2017","31","8.5","Overall 8.5    Story 9.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 8.5 Rewatch Value 8.0      It is a very good drama, but by faaaaar not one of the best. (Truthfully speaking, lately folks on MDL just throw around the 10s, it is totally misleading.)  The best about this drama, is by a long shot, the ACTING. Superb. The male lead and the second female lead were the outstanding stars for me - you could feel their sorrow and mood and they did not overact. And the male lead had a tough part to act, because...  ...the freakin' age gap! It made me cringe sometimes. I just couldn't overlook it, no matter how hard I tried. Sure, 19 and around 39 (or: 939) is not a total disaster, but it does come close to being inappropriate, especially since the female lead is written to be extremely teenagery, showing lots of little-girl-aspects.   Although the kissing scenes were really great and believable in themselves, the issue with the age just made it awkward to watch.  Anyways. The plot, not to forget, was okay, sometimes even really nice. The ending is really emotional and I liked it, because I did not expect it. (It squeezed even two tears out of me, and I am one of those viewers that never cry). The issue here is, that there were sometimes weird jumps between very, very serious topics and total slapstick. It was rather unusual and it made it sometimes difficult to follow the mood. The other thing was that in each episode there were several times that I was outright bored.  If you look at it from afar, there was not much plot going on besides the two lead couples circling around each other.   Is it a good drama? Yes. Is it a great drama? No.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

"MistyMaid","/profile/Mistymaid","Jan 23, 2017","24","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    This review may contain spoilers   STORY: This was probably the most inventive and creative dramas/story plot I've seen in the Korean entertainment industry yet! I adore fantasy because it strikes the imagination part of the brain in a fun way and I've seen some fantasy-genre Korean dramas but they don't involve a lot of fantasy elements. Most dramas I've seen that are labeled as ""fantasy"" or ""supernatural"" usually use these elements to support a story. They were more tools to carry the story along rather than being the main focus. 'Queen In Hyun's Man' was the closest I've seen to making fantasy as the main focus point, but still lacked emphasis on the genre. This drama really made the ""fantasy"" element THE main focus and you see the story support the genre rather than the other way around. I'm so proud and happy for Kim Eun Sook. She did a FANTASTIC job writing this drama! The world she created was so vivid and realistic in the sense that if there were such thing as goblins and grim reapers in this world, she made the idea fit into our 'real world' construct to make it believable that they might actually exist. I thought it was unique to have the idea that there were many grim reapers, instead of just one, and that they were organized in a governmental way. The reasons for their amnesia were pretty sound and the search for the goblin's bride was pretty inventive. Kim Eun Sook could've been lazy with the why of everything and make them the most conventional reasons possible, but she definitely took great stride into creating a story that weaved in and out with every action and every decision so that almost everything had a meaning and a real reason behind them.  Kim Eun Sook did a sublime job fleshing out the characters too! They definitely aren't the cookie-cutter type of characters you usually see in almost all romance Korean dramas, and I super appreciate that! It gets soooooooo unbelievably boring when I see the same type of character over and over again in every typical romance drama. Especially the male characters. They always turn out to be super mean and only to the main female character, but has a hard time expressing their feelings from their golden hearts. -__- !!  ACTING/CAST: This has been the best casting I've seen EVER! I'm not even joking! My favorite actress (for the current time) is Kim Go Eun and even though she's still young in the industry, she has AMAZING acting talents! She pulled off her character without a hitch. Same goes for Gong Yoo, who is a veteran in the entertainment industry and brings flourishes of experience from his time in the k-drama and k-movie business. Lee Dong Wook also did surprisingly well in this drama, although I still wish he was a bit more expressive. Maybe I'll get some upset comments about this, but he always seems to have this same indifferent look about him in every drama I've seen him in. But still, he did great in this drama, despite this fact. I considered Yoo In Na as a bit of a newbie in the entertainment business, but  glad she got to be in this drama because I definitely see good potential to grow her acting talents and be a very talented actress. Also have to give props to Yook Sung Jae and Lee El for their great portrayals of our Gods. Lee El has really good potential to be a great actress as well and hope that after being exposed in this drama, she'll have the opportunity to be in many more dramas as well. Maybe in a lead? She's always been the side character, haha!   MUSIC: I don't really pick on the music unless it's extremely good or extremely ill-fitting. Goblin's soundtrack was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! It fit the tone of the drama so perfectly and carried the emotional and lighthearted scenes so PERFECTLY! This is one of those rare moments where I want to download the whole track list to my phone so that I can listen to it whenever and where ever! What people don't often notice is that the music of a drama and the story is kind of like two halves of a whole. They really do have to fit well together or else the overall picture/concept of the drama becomes a little....off. But these two fit together absolutely perfectly!  OVERALL: I was going into this drama with big apprehension because the writer was Kim Eun Sook, who also wrote Descendants of the Sun, which I was absolutely bored to tears with. With the awesome cast in this drama but with Kim Eun Sook being the writer, I was worried that she would do the same thing as she did with DOTS. But I was thankfully relieved and pleasantly surprised! I know I sung praises up and down in this review for this drama, but please keep in mind that I rarely ever do this unless it demands that kind of praise. There's really only one other drama I gave a 9/10 or above and that was Liar Game (Korean version). This drama was well-directed, well-acted, and put together so well and so impressively that I really can't help say nothing but great things about it! The only reason why I gave this drama 9.5/10 instead of 10/10 is because of 'the contract' reasoning for our goblin (don't think that's a spoiler because you'd have to watch and know what the contract was) But other than that little lazy reasoning, Usually, I leave about a week to review a drama because I don't want the added hype of my own excitement to affect a review, but I'm very confidant that my thoughts and feelings for this drama will not waver for the reasons I wrote in this review, even as time passes. I would wholeheartedly watch this again and again! The cast, the story, and the music all blend and mesh together so well that it's painted the most beautiful picture I've seen yet!  NOTE: This is a somewhat slow-paced drama, so please understand that before watching. Some people don't like slow-paced because of our tendency to want instant gratification (especially with the younger folks, haha) But to be honest, this drama wouldn't have done so well if it were more fast-paced. I think being slow-paced as it is was the perfect speed for the story. If it were any faster, we'd be left with a less desirable ending and very rushed story.

And it's true that everyone talks about this drama. In my opinion, that because of two things: the OST and the cinematography. The soundtrack was really good and the songs as atmospheric as they should be, creating the right mood for every scene. Then, the cinematography was amazing, with the first episode introducing breathtaking shots of battles and palaces. The great cinematography continues on to the rest of the episodes as well, aiding when the drama hit standstills. In addition the theme is very original, as the plot wasn't clearly introduced to the audience, making you curious to want to see what's the buzz about this drama. Well, the story is very fairy tale like, a man is turned into a goblin and he is waiting for centuries to find the girl who will be destined to be his ""bride"", which will also mean that she will be able to pull the sword out of his body and kill him. Meanwhile, a grim ripper moves into his house and he falls in love with a human. And here is where it becomes complicated, as the concepts of reincarnation and four lives are introduced. Fortunately, they are clearly explained, so one can't easily be confused. Now, about the negatives: -the duration was way too long and that led to countless flashbacks to be thrown into each episode to make it longer. -the romance was a little blunt. The performances were great, and the second romantic story was really good, with the chemistry between the couple obvious. Maybe it was the age difference of the main couple (the girl was still in school) or the fact that the girl didn't actually treat the idea of being the goblin bride seriously; more like she used it as means to survive. It got better towards the end, fortunately, but till then it was awkward. -the main story could have been better presented -the ending was weak -the advertisements were too many!! Other than that, it was an enjoyable drama (still too long though!) and the side stories were the best of it. So, 5 out of 10.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The show didn't make me even curious about the ending so I didn't feel I was missing out on something by not watching anymore. For me, Goblin didn't succeed in living up to the expectations it created in the first episodes.  Pro's: beautiful sceneries, beautiful house, first episodes were interesting  Con's: romance was borderline pedophilia (19 years old high school girl with a 900 year old 40s looking man!

A lot of people have hated on the ending saying it was chaotic and rushed, but I actually found that I really enjoyed those episodes and the episodes where there were big reveals. Other than that, every one-hour episode felt twenty times as long.The antagonist that started to be introduced near the middle of the drama was something that REALLY intrigued me, especially given the parallel storylines — but it felt like the character and tension was never really explored fully. It was solved quickly and seemed to be used more as a plot device for separating the main couple.Speaking of the main couple — I don't think I was ever fully on board with them. The relationship always felt more familial, and age gap aside, I just didn't feel any chemistry between them. I also didn't like the secondary ship as much because the relationship just seemed to lack any content and connection aside from them being fated. Overall the arcs for both ships felt repetitive.There are a few things that I appreciate about the ending. but other things that I don't like. I'm also a time-skip-hater, but for some reason, I didn't dislike it as much in Goblin, but I'm not sure if it has to do with me not being emotionally invested at all or if it felt more in line with the way the plot was going.(Full disclosure: I've got some basic philosophical differences with the themes of this show, so that might have to do with me not clicking with it — more specifically, it's the idea of romantic destiny that I kind of scoff at.)

Full disclosure: I watched this drama because I needed to see more of Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na in leading roles after watching (and loving!) Touch Your Heart. I was always hesitant to watch Goblin because I've heard just how heartbreaking it was. I came in fully prepared knowing that I would cry my eyes out.And I did... but not for the main couple. I cried for the bromance of Goblin and Reaper. I cried for the romance between Reaper and Sunny. I even cried for the souls that Reaper led to the afterlife! But, I did not cry for Goblin and his bride and even skipped some of their scenes. The main reason for that was because I could NOT relate at all with the female lead. She acted like such a child for most of the drama... which is understandable since her character was a nineteen-year-old high-schooler!! My biggest gripe was that there was such a big difference in station between the male lead Kim Shin and the female lead Eun Tak. The ML was a powerful figure even in present-day; he literally can use magic, owns a mansion, has many people doing his bidding, and is incredibly rich. He also looks like he's in his mid-30s (no shade against Gong Yoo, just stating facts). Meanwhile, the FL was a poor, penniless high-schooler. She's 19 for most of the drama. There was SUCH an imbalance of power - in their experiences, because he's so much older than she, and in their social statuses as well. It was very disconcerting to see a romantic relationship develop between them.On the flip side, the bromance between Goblin and Reaper was great. Their interactions with each other were one of my favourites to see. The reveal later on in the drama broke my heart.What outshined everything was Reaper and Sunny's relationship. You knew from the moment they met that they were doomed in this lifetime. But the WHY was hidden until later and the reveal, again, was heartbreaking. But they pushed through, they accepted their fates... and they had their happy ending. So, to summarize:Story: It was ok. I did not care for the female lead and even the main plot of Goblin needing his bride to pull the sword from his chest was overshadowed later on by Reaper's past. Acting/Cast: Everyone played their parts well. As much as I disliked the female lead, Go Eun did a great job playing a high schooler in my opinion. My favourite was Dong Wook. He had me laughing with his hilarious outbursts and made me cry for his conversations with the souls and his expressive eyes.Music: They didn't have a lot of variety. The same music was played over and over again for the dramatic scenes. It wasn't my taste either.Rewatch Value: I wouldn't watch this drama in full. Can I just get a cut of the Reaper/Sunny moments and the bromances? Lol.Overall: An OK drama. If they had aged up the female lead, or aged down the male lead, then this drama wouldn't feel so... icky in some parts. Watch it for Reaper/Sunny, and then watch Touch Your Heart afterwards!

"AKAshon","/profile/AKAshon","Sep 12, 2020","11","5.0","Overall 5.0    Story 5.0 Acting/Cast 6.0 Music 7.0 Rewatch Value 4.0    This review may contain spoilers Overrated...  Seeing how Goblin is considered to be one of the most popular K-dramas of all time, being the most popular drama on MDL, I had to watch it. I wonder why it's so popular since though it is good, it isn't that good. There's plenty of K-dramas that are much better than Goblin with mainstream appeal like Crash Landing On You. I think its popularity can be attributed to the age and social class difference between its ML and FL. A wealthy older man with a poor, young student. Since its a bit taboo, the drama gets controversy which gets eyeballs to this drama. It also helps serve as wish fulfillment for  older men who lust after young women and young women who dream of an older man taking care of them, akin to Lolita. Anyhow, I thought that this Kdrama was addicting and engaging though I wouldn't say that it grabbed me like Crash Landing On You. The story didn't make much sense at times and there are moments that made me scratch my head, but it's an interesting melodrama that kept my attention nevertheless. That is until the last several episodes, which were melodramatic, nonsensical and boring unfortunately. I didn't care for the main couple (Goblin and Ji Eun Tak) to be honest. Not because of the age/class difference but rather because their story was quite boring. I prefer the relationship of the second leads (Reaper and Sunny), which was charming. Whenever there are scenes with the first leads, I would get restless and anxious for them to be over so that I could get Goblin and Grim Reaper scenes or Grim Reaper and Sunny scenes. I love the bromance between Grim Reaper and Goblin! To be honest, I ship them. I would have preferred that they got together instead. That would have made a better, far more interesting drama in my opinion. On a side note, it's impressive that Gong Yoo starred in the one of the most popular K-drama, Goblin, and also one of the most popular Korean films, Train to Busan.

I got to know that never judge a book by it's cover. I can surely say that it is one of the best Korean drama ever, I watched till date. Definitely you wont regret watching it. I am in love with the each and every character in it. This drama consists of each and every element you are looking for whether it might be comedy, romance, action, suspense, love, emotions. Each and every scene in this drama is drawn with some feeling in it. Especially it has a lot of emotional scenes which are worth to watch it. Gong yoo has made an expectional mark in this drama with his acting skills. The writer has done really a great job, the whole drama just flows like a river by revealing the past very smoothly.Absolutely stunning series! Get ready to laugh and cry during each episode. Best K-drama I've ever watched. It's very emotional, poignant, and hauntingly beautiful a Korean fairy tale of sorts mixed with an amalgamation of beliefs. Every lead performance and supporting performances are amazing. I won't give any spoilers but enjoy the show for its perfect cast and their tailor made performances for their roles, the amazing ost and art work, VFX and more.

It had a great intro and the cinematography was amazing, it has great actors and the chemistry between the male actors was absolutely flawless and also half the reason I bothered finishing this drama. But for a drama to be good the story has to be somewhat good too.The writing could have been so much better, it`s a story about grim reapers, ghosts, goblins, and gods who live unnoticed by normal humans. Many of the side stories were good, but it seemed like the writers put so little effort into the main story compared to the side stories and how much effort it was put into the cinematography.  I think the romance between the main couple was good, it didn`t care about the age difference it`s just that it was boring to watch compared to the secondary couple.  Conclusion; I think this drama is overrated and could`ve been so much better it had great actors, cinematography, and music but the story just dragged the drama so much down. It`s not a terrible drama I have watched a lot worse but it`s not a great drama either.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Went in with high hopes cuz everyone was talking about how good it was but nopestory:plot was original and i like the whole concept of this goblin and grim reaper + cinematography was amazing ngl. However. the pacing was too slow for my liking. One scene of Eun Tak looking at the leaves can take about 3 minutes and the age gap between the leads was disturbing (idk abt the rest but def was disturbing to me). Halfway through the drama, i just skipped through the love line of the main leads because it was lengthy and boring and instead, was more interested in the second lead love line - which indeed was loved by many more and they even got their own drama afterwards.  Overall, concept is good and unique, but pacing was too slow and there were many small problems in between.cast: needless to say, cast was amazing in acting. I especially liked SungJae's and Dongwook's acting.Music: gotta give credit to the music, very suited for the drama and vibes hahaOverall, something i wouldnt want to rewatch again because its too slow and boring for my liking.

When skimming over  reviews on this website for drama recommendations , I’m sure that most fellow drama watchers can agree that you should take what “ critics” sometimes  say with a pinch of salt, especially when a drama gets 10/10 on all categories.  Of course, it’s human nature that our tastes differ from one another. I’m sure most drama watchers  have been in my shoes, where someone will blatantly say to you that “ this drama, is the best one in the world” , and when you come to watch it via their recommendations, you can’t get even get through the first ten minutes of it  without internally screaming at the screen. Goblin is no exception . I remember the first time watching  Goblin and as one of my first few Korean dramas   , I was undeniably  a biased fan. I  denied a lot of evident  faults which has arisen to my  attention in the drama, because I had been    enchanted from episode one by   the show’s   cinematography.  ( As a fan of Ghibli Movies, the drama reminded me a lot of the detail behind characters and setting put  into some of my personal favourites ) . For a long time, I remember maintaining this biased opinion upon Goblin , until, I gained a new perspective from a friend who had never watched Goblin ( though she had seen a lot of  Korean dramas before) , and out of curiosity,   I asked her to give her own honest feedback after  watching it. Her own thoughts on  the drama ? She hated it with the passion. It surprised me a lot when she gave me  her honest feedback on the show. We’d nearly always seen eye to eye   on movies, shows and books, so, it was surprising that her opinion differed so greatly from my own. Out of curiosity, I asked her to elaborate on what annoyed her about it. Her list was certainly  endless, but, it did help to bring to mind even at the time, the classic  Marmite slogan   ; you either love it, or you hate it, and, Goblin is truly one of the two for drama fans . I’ll be honest in saying that my thoughts on the show didn’t magically change overnight, however, my friend’s criticisms did make me rethink a lot about my biased views on the drama. As a consequence, I decided to rewatch it, and it was only through watching again  without rose-tinted glasses, that I began to understand  my original thoughts that I had buried down in place of my love for the drama,  after watching  the show again .  First off, I will agree with nearly all of the reviews, that Goblin is  a fairly original drama . The blockbuster hit across Korea and overseas, does present  a fascinating  combination  of Korean mythology in a modern day setting with intriguing  characters, an unforgettable OST and of course beautiful backdrop settings as well. So, where can we find any faults, with  it then?First off, the episode lengths between 70-80 minutes. Of course, in comparison to some dramas, Goblin is about average for a Korean TV programme.  It  did  come to my attention , however, that in a lot of drama reviews, few critics have actually bothered to mention simply slow- paced some episodes became when a “ short” storyline was  paced for nearly  three hours, rather than finished in one completed episode in order to progress the storyline . Arguably, the drama did use some of this time to establish some key techniques , not least introducing our protagonists and foreshadowing later events as well. On the other hand, it still remains prominent exactly how key writer Eun Sook and of course the cast, were able to truly establish our characters in this seemingly endless amount of hours as well.    Gong Yoo’s performance as Kim Shin, was fairly impressive. I’ll be honest in saying, Gong Yoo was not notably memorable in comparison to other performances that I’ve seen by actors, however, he still portrayed  his role with a level of emotional appeal for viewers. Portraying a former  general trapped in a cursed immortal body,  I’m sure you can imagine the amount of raw appeal and questions of philosophy which were arisen by thoughts of immortality and morality within the show. On the other hand, it did come to my obvious attention watching the drama again ( and a shared criticism by my friend) , that Eun Sook had left out a lot of realistic qualities and characterisation techniques for Kim Shin. This is because Eun Sook had written not suggested any truly profound  psychological or pondering qualities towards a man who has lived for nearly a millennium  with  “ no love interests”.  Whilst I appreciate the romantic element of ‘ first love’ in the drama and of course concepts of chastity  in Korean culture, it was beyond ridiculous for Eun Sook to even mildly hint that   an adult man who had lived for centuries ,  had  never had a  one night stand nor interests in  any woman before Eun Tak. By far, Eun Sook did give  Ji Eun Tak some story writing justice  . This was explored brilliantly by  Kim Go Eun taking upon a younger, yet arguably  a more complex  portrayal of an adolescent at the time and Eun Sook making  Eun Tak a  more relatable and empathic character to  audiences than Kim Shin . Sadly, this  didn’t entirely  mean that she was  a more ‘ fleshed - out’  protagonist  either.  Whilst it was  certainly a lot more believable upon Eun Tak’s passing fancies for Kim Shin and her old classmate,  Eun Sook seemed to be focused a little too much upon Eun Tak as a  ‘  younger schoolgirl ‘ for a major proportion of the drama, highlighting an unrealistic  correlation between her naivety  against her age, intelligence and  circumstances  shown within  the show. As a consequence, this does raise a lot of issues with the age difference  between an emotionally vulnerable high schooler and an adult man as well. Am I being biased and arguing it would have been different if Kim Shin had been given to a “ young and fresher” actor like Sung Jae instead? No. The age gap is not actually the main problem, it seems.  Whilst the issue of  gaps certainly raised an eyebrow for me early on within the show, I can’t deny that the setup between the two characters  does explore  a maturation of different love forms between the two leads from friends to near family to a romantic setting in a  somewhat gradual  development for audiences. Where my  criticism  lies is certainly within  the factor that neither leads are truly explored because of this age gap, as being realistic love interests for   one another. There were no explorations of emotional trials, similar tastes or expanding their feelings realistically to one another at all within the show, even in the apparent emotional conclusion of the final episode.  Then of course aside from our main leads, there’s also the portrayals of the Grim  Reaper  (Dong Wook) , Sunny (Yoo In-Na ) and spoilt Chaebol heir  Yoo Deok Hwa  (Yook Sung Jae). With regards to his role as the Reaper , Dong Wook interestingly said in an interview once, his embarrassment at not living down his role in the show and it’s easy to see why . Dong Wook’s portrayal from the seemingly callous and  sardonic figure to  a  soft-hearted soul, added to some more touching and humorous  moments  in a show centralised upon romance. Aside from his comically heart -driven romance with Sunny, the Reaper’s relationship with the Goblin was portrayed in brilliant fraternal-style for audiences which will easily make you laugh and your heart breaking within later scenes in the show. Although there was  some out -of -place lines and cheesy acting moments, Eun   Sook did undeniably do Dong Wook justice in this role, however, in a similar manner to Shin and Eun Tak, there was a lot of left out realism within the Reaper, especially  psychologically. It’s undeniable that Sunny and the Reaper’s relationship had a level of comical chemistry between essentially a naive man with lacking social interactions , and a social butterfly each seeking their own comfort within one another’s company.  Yoo In-Na did give a genuine sense of authenticity within her portrayal as a healthy sister figure for Eun Tak as a character, something which  thankfully didn’t  drive downwards into the typical cliche of female animosity, however, in  a slightly more honest manner,  Yoo In-Na nor Eun Sook, truly add anything   jovially new to the cliche female flirt role of Sunny. Whilst she did play her role intriguingly later on within the show, for a high percentage of the drama, she was a perfect example of a ‘ stock female lead’; flirtatious , comical and a perfect plot device, but certainly not a sincere human being with with any exposure in flashbacks , relationships prior to any of the other protagonists   or expressions of any  sincere emotions.  In a similar manner whilst  Yook Sung Jae doesn’t shine out as much as Go Eun or Dong Wook, his performance was still surprisingly well retained as the stereotypical “ spoilt heir” who shows a deeper side to his personality during the course of the show. My biggest complaint with Eun Sook’s characterisation of Deok Hwa was that there was a lot of brimmed  potential with Sung Jae ‘s portrayal. Rather than giving Sung Jae any justice in a similar manner to In-Na, Sung Jae is left as the sort of stock ‘ clown character ‘ of the drama. What makes this even more ironic is that  Eun Sook suggested later in the show  a more complex and intriguing quality to Deok Hwa, which was unsurprisingly disregarded later that episode and once he had been of use to this particular storyline, Deok Hwa was nearly entirely disregarded as a character by the ending of episode 16. In addition to this portrayal of characters and questionable storyline , there’s the other slightly more trivial complaint of excessive product placement. Whilst this doesn’t entirely take away from the originality of the plot, seeing a Subway or a placement for Paul’s Boutique  in the middle of a scene which could have been used for original character progression and storyline  considering Eun Sook’s missed links, did irk me a bit personally. Critically, I think it’s fair to say that I can only give you my personal thoughts on the drama. Goblin is one of those shows which you you sort of have to  watch yourself to work out whether you love it or hate it.  There will be  some people who have entirely disagreed with everything that I’ve said in this review, and arguably some who have felt the same as well, and that, is perfectly entitled either way . Regardless of your thoughts on the matter, Goblin has strengths and faults for everyone, but it’s certainly a show you shouldn’t miss out upon as well.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The main romance was childish and gross. It was so uncomfortable to watch that I don't know how I got through it. The main female lead has such a childish character. The undertones of the drama were weird, they shouldn't have been a couple. People hate other dramas for having a weird age gap, but Goblin never gets mentioned. I think this drama is one of the worst ones because their maturity level was not at the same level. If there is going to be an age gap I think writers should consider the maturity needed to give real consent. I'm glad people are finally starting to realize the importance of age gaps and real consent though.About the storyline:Even besides the romance, the main storyline was confusing. There was more emphasis on aesthetics than the story. I would say watch the first two episodes then stop. It goes downhill from there.  At one point in the drama, around episode 12 or 13, I found myself skipping through a lot of it. I watch dramas for the storyline much more than the cute moments or aesthetics, so if you feel the same way, I do not think you will enjoy this drama. I wish I had written this review when the episodes were first coming out. It was so weird to see everyone say they loved it. About the good parts:The music in this drama was fantastic, and, in my opinion, one of the only redeemable qualities about it. I love Gong Yoo, but this drama was not it. Episode 1 and 2 were exciting for sure, but I cannot recommend this drama farther than those two episodes.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

You're probably thinking that I'm exaggerating, but I can assure you there's no doubt that this is an amazing drama that's given me tears, lots of them, both happy and sad.  The story is ambitious, let me tell you. The fantasy genre is not for the weak. Many try, but there are few survivors. They tend to fall short, leave the audience wondering, and the plot becomes shaky. Goblin, though marched right up to the top (easily) and stuck it's flag in, claiming its rightful place as the best fantasy drama made so far. It tells a story that spans 900 years, relying heavily on drawing parallels between past and present, but coherently weaves all the little details into place. Everything makes sense, and leaves the audience in suspense through the entire show with it's twists and turns. The fantasy aspect is absolutely amazing as it's used both comically and as important elements for the plot. It's never used just to show off the effects they can do. The show forms such an amazing atmosphere as if you were in another world, and as an artist, I can assure you that this is the most aesthetically appealing show I have ever seen.   The acting was of course, top notch, with this star studded cast. By star studded, I don't mean idols; These are talented and renowned actors that have proven their excellent acting abilities with their previous work. Fun fact, Lee Dong Wook, who normally has lead roles, begged and begged the writer to cast him as the SECOND lead. That's how good this script was, and you bet he worked his butt off for this drama. Gong Yoo, I'm sure you've seen in plenty of other movies, namely Train to Busan, never overacts, but conveys so much emotion and is just perfect for his role. There have been people talking badly about the lead actress, saying she isn't pretty enough, but I think she's absolutely gorgeous and has such a pure smile. She fits her role so well and you can't help but love her.   Since the drama does everything else so well, I guess you can't expect its OST to be perfect as well right? But it is. Many of the tracks have gotten millions of views on Youtube and I have the entire OST replaying on my phone. All of the music is just so atmospheric and fitting for the show. I mean it when I say I love every single song, and that's pretty rare. I mean when's the last time you loved every song on an album?   Alright well, I guess I'm done singing praises for this drama. I can't find a single thing to criticize, not because I'm biased, but because it's just THAT good. By now you may have guessed, but I wholeheartedly urge you to try this. You'll find yourself rolling around with laughter, pain, and feels so if you don't try it I may have to personally go over there, sit you down, and force you to watch it. Now I'm off to cure this post Goblin hangover and maybe cry in a corner. Shoot me a PM if you need me (especially for fangirling or crying purposes I'm here for you)!

That's why when I watched Goblin, I have expected a lot from it. And, honestly, I have my ups and downs as I watch this show. Nevertheless, this is a unique masterpiece that viewers need to see as Asian dramas continue to go through paradigm shift.  Story: It started really well. AS IN REALLY WELL HAHAHA. The first episode topped most of the movies and other dramas' first episodes that I have watched. I have continued to like it as it shows the development of the characters and the relationships that they're in. However, I felt a lack of depth (just a little) to the story as I reached the half of it, and also, as I continued to watch it, questions about the characters, their statements, their actions, and their memories have risen. I wanted them to redeem the show, and guess what? THEY DID. The story ended not as big as the start of it, but it ended with a touch in the heart. My questions were also answered, komabta!  Ending: I really liked it. Especially the ending for Sunny and Grim Reaper. :D  Acting/Cast: The actors were good. However, I only want to mention these three characters that I salute, and the actors that have portrayed the role: (1) Kim Woo Bin/Wang Yeo/Grim Reaper. He's my favorite because of his sense of humor and how this sense opposes his being the deliverer of dead souls. Lee Dong Wook is really gooooood! I can't think of others who will fit the drama more than him. (2) Lee El. HUHUHUHUHU :'( every scene that she's in, I was very happy. Her character shows that we are never alone in this world. And Lee El is really fit for this role huhuhu she's so beautiful btw. And last, (3) Sunny. Her chemistry with Grim Reaper is daebak!!! Their pair is, by far, one of the best. I liked her innocence and at the same time, her strong personality. In Na is realllllllly beautiful omo please be with me hahaha I am not biased with her, but she's so good here haha. All in all, the cast displayed a wonderful performance.  Music: UNDERRATED! IT SHOULD BE 14/10 HAHAHAHAHA THE MUSIC IS ONE OF THOSE THAT DROVE ME TO WATCH THIS SHOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. OSTs here are the best (my opinion)  Rewatch Value: Worth watching again.  Overall: Dramas have flaws. I believe that there is no perfect drama. But what makes an excellent drama is its consistency and its heart. I believe that this drama has both. And even when people bash this because of the lack of chemistry ( I admit that there is a lack but not too much) or the confusing facts ( But they explained it at the end well),  I personally want to recommend it to other people.  The effects were great, too. I also liked how the camera captures the scenes, especially the close-up ones. I think they did a pretty good job in terms of editing.  A GUY'S CONCLUSION 101: I don't want to forget. Oblivion may be a grace, but forgetting goblin, her bride, grim reaper, sunny, goddess of birth, deok hwa and everyone of them would bring me more pain.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I've been reading a lot of its reviews, stalking the fuck out of Lee Dong Wook and basically just obsessing over this one a little too late. I usually try to stray clear of fantasy genre but I hate that I didn't give this one a chance sooner. It's like one of those overly popular dramas that have got the mainstream vibe to it because almost everyone has watched it already and I guess now I know why. I've got so many things on my mind regarding the series, the good things and the bad ones too that it's a bit hard to formulate them properly into words so I'll probably just rant my way out.Starting off, Goblin was an extremely whimsical watch to say the least.The first few episodes were absolutely breathtaking with immaculate cinematography both in the historical flashbacks and in current timeline, interesting choice of characters and plot will force you deeper into this drama, and once you're in well, there's no going back thereafter.The plus point of the drama was definitely its character interactions with underlying but hugely effective humour. I personally prefer things to be serious and funny both at the same time, too much of just one set of emotion gets boring for my attention span. So needless to say Goblin nailed this one requirement of mine perfectly.Each and every character dealt with the other in such a playful and satisfying way for most part of the series that I couldn't help but connect with them on a deeper,  more intimate level.That said, don't even get me started on the (b)romance between the Goblin and Grim reaper, probably the best I've seen yet (that says a lot considering bromance is a fairly common trope in K-drama world) they were just so entertaining together that at one point I was just watching the drama, waiting to get a glimpse of their quirky interactions (which were a lot thankfully). So if anyone asks me why I loved this drama as much as I did, I'll gladly put my hand on my heart and just think of all the cheeky moments between these two extremely good looking hunks.Now coming to the romance, I found the story of Grim Reaper and Sunny a lot more captivating and emotionally investing than the protagonists despite the limited screen time. Not to belittle the leads or to say they were lacking or anything, they were good too in their own way. While the Reaper and Sunny had a heavy hot dose of chemistry sizzling through; the Goblin and his bride were the cutesy heart fluttering couple. The show got a lot more interesting seeing these two romantic parallels unfolding side by side. Not to mention the very evident age gap didn't bother me at all, if more I found it quite endearing and romantic since one of the involved party was a lonely immortal being while the other was an equally lonely but warm hearted magical soul. So whatever works for them in this life and after am all for it without any second thoughts whatsoever.As much as I was intrigued by the plot and the never ending suspense of how things were going to pan out in the end, the last few episodes were a let down as compared to the heavy plot build in the previous ones. While the story went a full circle it failed to actually make sense. The logic and reasoning shredded into nothingness just like how Goblin was supposed to? But after a short amount of separation he reappeared as if nothing happened only god knows how (pun intended).  Many other plot points came off as mere convenience which I possibly couldn't ignore at the end. The story of the Reaper got a whole lot diverted and complicated but I suppose it's a given since rounding up a fantasy takes an even more fantastical on the spot thinking. The writers could have done better because the plot turned out to be a sore spot for this one for sure.Focusing on the actors, obviously they did a fine job on this one. The emotion transitions were perfect, the comic timing even more so and the inner turmoil in each of the 4 leads was something I actually felt and sympathised with especially in the case of Reaper's identity revelation. Lee Dong Wook has got me spellbound and am probably off to binge watch on his other remaining dramas.Last but definitely not the the least. The OSTs! Oh my lord the OSTs are so on point in every damn scene and the fact that I absolutely love every one of them tunes (still humming round and round) is something that happens rarely.So if you're looking for a feel good, fanciful world with beautiful and funny people roaming about it, be sure to delve into this one, if you haven't already.

First off, the story is phenomenal. I always give dramas 10 minutes to see if it'll hook me. If it doesn't, for the most part, I'll have a hard time finishing it for some reason. Within minutes, I already knew I would love this Kdrama. The casting is spot-on. I can't think of another person who could play the Grim Reaper as well as  Lee Dong Wook or Gong Yoo as the Goblin. The dry humor and bromance between the two are what I enjoyed the most.  None of the characters ""bugged"" me. Not a one. In almost every drama, one character will rub me the wrong way. Instead, in this drama, every character became important to me. The two separate love stories complemented each other so well. You rooted for both and there was no jealousy or games that you usually see in other dramas. The emotional feelings aren't forced like in a lot of other dramas, where you feel like they set it up just to make you cry. In this drama, there are heartbreaks, but many feel-good moments. A great balance. The music was great and I felt the choice of the songs was spot-on. Great production as well. It doesn't matter who I recommend this show to, whether it is male or female, old or young, they have all enjoyed it. I highly recommend this if you've never seen it. I wish I saw this sooner.

However, after about 2years or so,  I figured I’d give this drama a chance. after watching this entire drama, I’ve realized that this drama is heavily overrated, the fandom of this drama is overly biased, and majority the reviews on these platforms have next to no substance. Most reviews (I’ve read a couple high rated reviews) just praise the MLs, praise the visuals, mention the faulty age gap, criticize the FL for being childish, praise the secondary leads relationship(or lack thereof), then give the drama 10/10 (undeservedly so). I won’t be doing any of the said above.First of all, I won’t give a reiteration of the story. If you wanna know what it’s about, read the drama synopsis. 2ndly, for the life of me, I don’t understand this obsession fans have with couples with varying ages, but I’d like to think that fans mention it to put themselves on some moral pedestal. 3rdly, I really believe this drama could’ve been great. Hell, it could’ve been amazing. If there’s one thing that encompasses all the problems this drama has, it would be that it focuses on the past too much. It also made the ML cold, dubious, and doubtful that he would ever find his bride. There should’ve been more focus on the present, letting the leads establish a better relationship on screen, instead of the ML constantly giving the FL whiplash and making her doubt herself more than she already does. The FL does such an amazing job, and is so mature whenever she’s faced with a difficult situation. When the Goblin presents himself in her life, she accepts her new destiny with stride and determination,and that is what makes her the best, most redeemable character in this show. Circling back to all the flashbacks, it becomes quite evident that the only person that can account for what transpired 900yrs ago (why 900 though? why not 50, or 70? wtf even is this?) is the goblin himself, yet he’s supposedly carried this vengeance in his heart all this time. I can’t even remotely fathom why the writers of this drama thought this was such a great idea, but I’ll give my 2 cents.— It’s impossible to hold onto a grudge for that long. Furthermore, these are PAST lives, so as far as I’m concerned, anyone that was reincarnated, the people of their past are their ancestors. Not only do the characters of the present not remember anything, they are NOT the same people. They have their own personalities, their own minds, their own souls. so the concept of them being the same people falls flat for me.ngl, I hated episode 13 & 15 for making me cry, but ep13-16 were the only episodes worth watching. around these episodes is when you actually see chemistry between the FL & ML, and the Goblin is actually concerned about Eun Ji Tak. The final episodes wrecked me, not because it’s such a great drama, but because the acting really is exceptional, and the FL is excellent at portraying emotions, especially when she’s devastated.(also the viewers of ep 14 are the most insensitive fucks I’ve ever seen. I read the timed comments, you know who you are, worthless degenerates). just for clarification, I hate crying.The best thing about this drama is Eun Ji Tak, the Grim Reaper, and the music. that’s it. also, why would anyone make a drama whereby everything revolves around the FL, only to kill her in the last episode? seems counterintuitive, but wtf do I know? This may be the first drama I’ve ever watched where I’m just waiting for it to be over. it wasn’t terrible, just makes no sense how all these supernatural beings have all these powers, but they’d rather only intervene in terrifying situations when they want to. what really leaves me baffled is how the acting is so amazing, but the story itself is such trash. I only finished this drama because I was already too invested. unfortunately, I don’t recommend this drama. If anything, go watch Seo Bok instead; it’s underrated, and most likely makes a load more sense than Goblin. Also, Gong Yoo’s birthday is in 2 weeks(July 9), so go celebrate watching something worthwhile( that’s not Goblin). ?  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

It had some good visuals and an ambitious story, but when it came to the execution, it stumbled pretty hard. The pacing felt way too slow, dragging on with these super long episodes that struggled. Character development, which is crucial for a good drama, felt disappointingly shallow. The important characters just didn't get the depth they needed, making them feel kind of distant and undeveloped. The romance was generally bad and forced, lacking that genuine chemistry that should've pulled at the heartstrings.The story itself got a bit messy sometimes, throwing in inconsistent mythological bits that interrupted everything. Even though ""Goblin"" had its moments of grandeur and some heartfelt acting, it couldn't keep up a consistently engaging storyline or build compelling character arcs.

The show explored interesting themes about life, death, and the possible realms that exist in between.  You get to see some beautiful cinematic footage, and most of the acting was on point, especially with Lee Dong Wook playing a Grim Reaper.  He deserves a lot of credit for making his character the most complex and interesting one in the show.   Plus, does he not give Puss-in-Boots a run for his money in terms of being able to seduce the audience with such big, sad eyes?  It is quite an art to be able to fill up your eyes like that with such sorrowful tears so often and so masterfully.  Unfortunately, there were a lot of inconsistencies and unexplained phenomena in the story line, especially toward the end.  I was disappointed with the last few episodes; they felt rushed and slapped together last minute.   In fact, I think that's what really happened, considering the delays in production.  The creators had opportunities to tie together the themes they touched upon and get creative with it, but they completely missed those chances.  And talk about overdoing it with the product placement!    All that being said, I still loved it, if not mostly for the awesome and unbearably cute bromance between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook.  They had great chemistry together and their dynamic was way more interesting than the actual boy-girl romance, in my opinion.  They are two of my favorite actors, so there you go, I'm totally biased!   With this bias in mind, I give it a generous 8 out of 10.    I'm secretly kind of glad it was a letdown at the end, because otherwise I'd be feeling those post-drama blues!

There are works of art, however, that do not lend themselves to such criticism. Goblin is one such show.   It's not perfect. The faults I mentioned (and those that have been and will be mentioned by others) are present in Goblin. Yet Goblin isn't the sort of artwork to reveal these faults to the engaged viewer.   Again, much will be said in the way of critique and analysis, as it should be. But if you come across this show and ever find yourself immersed — hopefully in the first episode — Goblin will refuse to release you until its final moment. It does what every artist hopes their work will do: it submerges you in the world it constructs and, when it ends, leaves a part of its world with you.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I have a lot of problems with this show, but I'll start off with the most major one, the age gap. She was a 19 year old girl in HIGH SCHOOL and he was a grown ass middle aged man (939 but whatever he looks 50 in the show). Would it have killed the writers to make the fl a little older?? Or at least choose an older and mature looking actress?? Even the actors themselves had a 10 year age gap in real life I can only imagine how awkward it must have been... I was so uncomfortable watching their so called ""romantic"" scenes because all I could see was a father-daughter dynamic. She literally calls him ""ahjussi"" for god's sake. It is so creepy and vile that so many people support this and even more so, ROMANTICIZE IT.  How and why are people not seeing a problem with this??The story is nothing special, I was bored out of my mind and sometimes, I would play a game where I would try and finish the dialogue of what a character was saying or try to predict the next scene or plot point, that's how clichéd, boring and predictable this was. I was bored even while watching this on 2x speed. And of course all the 3 main characters are magically reincarnated with the same faces and personalities and conveniently meet each other again. What was the point of dying if that was going to happen? The constant flashbacks to Kim Shin's life 900 years ago were so boring like bro move on it's been a century ????. The main leads had no chemistry whatsoever, maybe this show would have been a little less detestable if Kim Shin and Ji Eun-tak were father and daughter instead of ""lovers"". The second lead couple also had no chemistry. Eun tak's character was plain and boring, she is a blank slate with no personality or mind of her own. Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook's visuals and bromance carried the show in all honestly. I genuinely cannot fathom how this hot mess came to be the 4th highest rated TvN show and most popular show on MDL...I honestly see this show as a stain in LDW's career, he has so many hits like A Shop for Killers, Strangers from Hell, etc...I wonder why he chose this show...I could go on and on, but I think I've said enough. This show is a hot piece of garbage and I regret watching it. Watch this show if you hate yourself and like seeing minors getting groomed.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I had seen so many people mentioning how good this drama was that I decided to give it a go having nothing else to watch. I was disappointed and I didn't even have high hopes as I find hyped shows are usually not my cup of tea.The first third of this drama was hard to watch and I had to push myself to continue, mostly I found the portrayal of a 19 year old girl very unrealistic, she was very childish. Maybe it's just me, but I've never met (nor was I that way) anyone that age to act like that. Then I kind of got used to it by the middle, but also she seemed to slowly get out of it when she turned 20, what was also unrealistic. To top it over, Goblin was doing the opposite and as the drama goes he becomes more childish. Not going to lie it was funny at times, but overall it was mostly cringy. The age gap of the characters was problematic (without taking into account the 900 years) and to me it made it worse the fact they blatantly tried to make this look better by making him more childish, also because it felt it tainted his character as this important and powerful Goryeo warrior. I feel there was a problem with trying to keep this balance of wanting to be serious and sad and tragic with the romcom aspect, I couldn't take things as seriously.I think the story would have been a lot better had they started it when she was 29, it could have been way more mature. I did like the relationship of the 3 as housemates though and I found it the best part of the show.There are too many plotholes and I could give it a pass if it wasn't because they had plenty of running time to address them. For example, the images of their Goryeo lives were repeated over and over way too much but in the end I didn't feel they fully showed well enough how things happened. Despite those images, I'm being told what happened more than shown, what is a shame. A lot of times the show seemed to go in circles not wanting to commit to a path for the story, at least not until the later episodes as usual (I seriously dislike this common thing of not doing anything until two episodes of the end, make a film instead!!), but by the end I was already kind of tired of the story to the point that I couldn't care enough for the consequences that were about to happen to the characters. Talking about characters, so many side characters with lost potential and so many plotholes in all characters.The ending is... I don't want to say bad because it could have been worse, but... it's bad. Could have been poetic, could have been satisfactory but it's none and it's solved in the most weird, anticlimatic and pointless way in my opinion. So much potential for epic-ness wasted in there.I have watched worse dramas than this one, but I still don't think I would be able to recommend this one if simply for the fact it's too long and not much happens to justify its run time. If it's because any or all of the actors, then go ahead, but if you don't care about the actors and are there for the story then I would say look somewhere else because this is not it.

"MariKim","/profile/BeKmari","Jan 28, 2017","9","9.5","Overall 9.5    Story 9.5 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 9.0      Summary: If you haven't already, watch this drama.  Can we just take a moment to acknowledge Kim Eun-sook's wonderful storytelling. And a standing O for the cast and all the production crew for their hard work!  +/- Plot:  Hardly have I ever encountered a drama that has required me to think outside of the box when looking for the plot twists and trying to theorize about the backstory and characteristics of a character. The story as a whole was unexpectedly thrilling and as the weeks continued through, more questions erupted--but never in a way that left me utterly confused and unsatisfied. I loved how we slowly came to fully understand how the characters were previously connected and such.  I will say however, that midway through I slightly lost some interest as there wasn't much romance development. But it was understandably adorable as I assume they wanted to play up the innocence factor, it being a ""first love"" and all.  The only reason I gave the storyline a 9.5 was because there's no option for a 9.8 and I wanted to give a more honest rating. I was not in love with the ending of the show, to be perfectly honest I would have been over the moon with episode 15 being the final episode. I just felt that the final episode was a little ??, although looking back on it I realize that it was kind of a nice touch for the final character development of Ji Eun-Tak.  +/- Acting/Cast: I felt as though the cast as a whole had such great chemistry, everyone just seemed to mesh together so well and all seemed so at ease and comfortable in their characters. It's something that's pretty uncommon I'd say. It was heartwarming to see the fun times that the cast shared behind the scenes and how they're so at ease especially throughout their ad-libbing sections.  The sizzle between Kim Go-Eun and Gong Yoo is undeniable! It's like a needle in a haystack when you find kisses this good in the copious amounts of dramas produced. I'm happy to say that it's getting better though! But back to the actors, Kim Go-Eun really sparkled in this roll. She had the perfect amount of innocence as the school girl and maturity as the character grew up. And I'll try to contain my fangirling, but we all know that Gong Yoo has stolen every girl and woman's heart. He is both wonderfully intense as the Goryeo Man and soooo adorable in his first love.  My goodness, that bromance though. It was sweet to see how we saw the brotherhood grow deeper as they grew more fond of one another. Not only was the chemistry and witty banter between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook amazing, but the extra comical effect of Yook Sungjae made everything perfection. I really hope to see them working together in the future! (If you haven't seen Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook's amazing spoofs of the cover artwork, you definitely should--so cute!) And a special shout out to the beautiful Yoo In-Ha, so much beauty, charisma, and sass packed into her character. She was even more comical than I expected and it totally worked...also unexpected.   +/- Music:  All of the music was perfectly interwoven with the filmography! I couldn't believe my eyes and ears when Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook came strutting down the dark road, it was just pure matrimony. I am a huge fan of the soundtrack and have been listening to it on repeat for at least 2-3 days straight. My favorite song from the album changes from day to day, so that tells you that all of it is simply amazing.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Well thats the main issue with this show. Im used to slow paced story in korean TV shows and im ok with it but this is just over the top. The thing is that screentwriters didnt come up with a strong story in the first place so as with many other korean dramas, they make up some lazy plot twists in the middle of the show without giving you any clue whatsoever. I dont really like that cause it makes the show cheap. The story feels extremely slow, the main twist is very sudden without any deep reason and the last few episodes are just straight up slow torture cause at that point nothing makes sense.

One day, she blows out her birthday candle and accidentally summons a goblin. Not just any goblin, but a world-weary 900-year-old immortal Goblin named Kim Shin, for whom she is fated to remove the magical sword from his chest and finally let him rest in peace, or else death will come to her instead. Kim Shin wanted to end his immortal life but in order to do that, he had to give up his only love and then he had to end his life to save her. Now, how can this end happily?At it’s core, Goblin is a high-stake romance with unsolved past conflicts that centers around death, reincarnation, grief, and forgiveness. Not only it's hilariously charming, it’s also painfully soul-crushing. Watching each scene feels truly magical and for me it is thanks to the God-tier OSTs that are played in the scenes so flawlessly, it amplifies all the emotional beats. Other aspects are also top-notch: acting, characterizations, camera work and cinematography. My favorite part is, of course, all the bromance moments between Kim Shin and Grim Reaper, their funnies and their long-lasting bond. They gave fresh comedies that I love to rewatch and laugh again. That said, I'll always be a little bitter that they wrote Ji Eun Tak as a high-schooler who wears her school uniform with her freaking bowtie most of the time! I never understand and I feel really bad about it. Plus, Kim Shin is just a very immature rude jerk at first. I see Goblin and Eun Tak as friends more than lovers. This is why romance is not my main enjoyment watching this drama, and while the chemistry between Sunny and Grim Reaper is unmatched, they deserve more couple moments! It’s a bit waste of potential and frustrating to watch them meet and part ways repetitively just for exchanging biodata and unrevealing a tiny bit of mystery. Regardless, I recommend Goblin to anyone as plot is uncomplicated and you’ll be amazed by the beauty of it.

Goblin focuses one two couples and their epic stories of growth, tragedy, and just daily life. The plot itself is rather simple and thin, but still enjoyable. The show is full of cute and funny scenes that will keep you watching. Keep in mind, the show feels more like a slice of life rather than a supernatural adventure, so if you're out for some magical battles, Goblin isn't the show to watch. An issue that prevented me from fully immersing myself in the story was the main protagonists' love story. There is no real build up to help you understand why Eun Tak and Kim Shin fall in love. They both need something from on another, whether it's to end an immortal life or just have the support of someone, but it's not enough to help solidify why they eventually fall in love. There's something lacking in their budding romance leaving it awkward and strange until you simply decide to accept it for what it is and keep watching.Overall, having simple story lines to follow allowed Goblin's pacing to breath leaving a ton of space for a lot of the funny moments I mentioned earlier. And, like many other dramas, the flashbacks are overused. Couple of ticks on the fast forward button and you've got a light and enjoyable drama.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Nevertheless, I'll try to be as objective as possible, despite the fact that this is still a subjective opinion of a person. Personally, I find the romanticism of most scenes too cheesy and long. It's not because I dislike the type in general as I'm a regular consumer of kdrama and I quite like the time the show gives for the audience to process the emotions. However, the age gap lead to a large portion of the scene being unused because they can't physically do anything to lovey dovey as it's not appropriate. In the end, I didn't find myself emotionally attached and invested into the character.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

There was a lot of fluff and misunderstandings which end up extending the runtime a lot.The best part of the show was the ghosts stories. Some of the characters/world building was pretty inconsistent but the show doesnt really take itself too seriously anyway so its fine. Its mostly a fun watch with some emotional highs and lows. The forshadowing and symbolism throughout the show is pretty well done. Dalkom coffee and subway making their return in this show as well.Sometimes the way the scenes were cut were a bit disorienting wtih them having several cuts in a row for a pretty simple conversation. The music and ost in the show is pretty solid. Really enjoyed the music especially with dramatic scenes. The slice of life story contains other elements like mystery, romance and manage to blend them well into the show. The only complaint is that there was a lot of unecessary things that happen due to lack of communication. Some characters actions are also very convenient for the story and are essentially just to advance the plot. The lore of the story is also somewhat inconsistent/doesnt really make sense. Characters being inconsistent to their lore was probably for irony purposes, but was kinda silly.The acting was very good overall, carrying a lot of the emotional scenes. Especially when the show itself is mostly humour.  +1If the show ended at episode 14, it would have been peak. -1Because of the scene where they threw out a plate of food because someone put too much spice on it. -1Ghost stories epic. +1 Dramatic scenes were dramatic, sad scenes were sad, funny scenes were funny. Good stuff. Very enjoyable.Overall, Gobolin.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I watched this after a really long time, because I tend to ignore shows that are more hyped!The concept is fantastic, nothing original, but good. The whole romance story was weird as hell in the first half. I mean, the girl is 18 and the Goblin is 900+ but even if we don't care about that because this is a fantasy, his real age is around 30+ or something.  The chemistry between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun in the first was more like a dad and daughter, and when the romance started for real it was even more weird, because she always called him ""Ahjussi"". After the 9 years time skip, it was much, it was like two adults. I feel they should've start with Eun Tak as an adult already. Also, like with many other Kdrama, especially with fantasy, the plot was all over the place. I hate when characters don't speak up and say what they want to say. Some of the problems they had to face were solved pretty easily. When he finally dies, I thought he might get a second chance to live a normal life, but no. He came back as a Goblin again. Why? Makes zero sense. If they bring him back as a Goblin, at least let them live together till she dies in old age.She spent 9 years ""waiting"" for him, she even wrote a note for herself, yet in all these years she never mentioned it or moved on? Come on now. Only 2 people remembered him, so she should've moved on. Especially, because Sunny never said a single thing. She watched her friend suffering, even had to take pills for her heart, yet she didn't do anything. This whole amnesia plot was messed up. The way they brought him back is even worse! In 9 years, she never blew out a candle? Who believes that? It's not like she lived alone. No one ever bought her a cake in 9 years? The most frustrating part of the story is probably the fact that they killed her in the finale, so they can have like a 2 minute long scene at the end as a child again. What the heck? At least the story with Sunny and the Reaper was better. The bromance was funny as hell, and there were so many good things on the show, it's just frustrating, because with a little more focus on the writing, this show could've been perfect. Even with all the problems, I think I will rewatch it once or twice.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

But i would say this is probably the longest buildup i have ever seen. It has 16 episodes, and the actions and dramatic parts start at around ep.11 12. Before that it was about character building and bonding (those memories will be used effectively against us later).The fantasy romance story is intriguing. It has good plot twists and back story. Although the pacing is sometimes a bit slow, overall it sends meaningful messages of love, hate, afterlife, regret, loneliness and forgiveness. It can break your heart and also make you smileThe acting is good, nothing to complain about. The chemistry between the second lead couple is so good at all time. At the beginning the main couple feels a bit lacking, near the end it gets a lot better. But the best chemistry has to be the bromance between Goblin and Grim Reaper!The characters are well built and developed, relatable and make reasonable decisions. But mostly they are madly driven by love.The music is so beautiful and sad, wished they had kept the ending song till the end though. The special effects feel natural (the glowing sword and the power of grim reaper), but the flying moments were a bit off.The atmosphere changes so fast. One moment it's fluff and romantic (with a little too many staring-straight-at-each-other-for-a-century), and a second later it's heart wrenching and full of dramas and actions. It's was well-balanced, i just wished it was more consistent.Overall, i would recommend this series if you are looking for a romance story sets in the present, with wholesome bromance, fantasy elements and a tragic backstory from a past life, which would now affect the choices and emotions of the characters.

I came to care most for its characters because the actors made them lovable, unlike the story itself, which is sloppy and muddled in its lore.This is a fantasy romance, which are usually up my alley.  However, this one could have been better had the story stuck to its own rules.  What ensues are quite a lot of plot holes and overly dramatic performances.  I suppose the writers are hoping you will overlook its many flaws and focus on the romance between our MCs.  That is fine for some.  I like my dramas to be a little better thought out and organized.A lot is going on here.  We have a young, high school aged girl who is lonely and looking to belong.  We have a god/guardian who has been living in immortality since a tragedy caused him to be what he is.  He is searching for his bride as she will have the power to end his long existence and give him peace.  Enter grim reapers with complicated backstories and gods playing with human lives, and the story becomes a complicated mess because it doesn't stick to its own rules.  Some things are never really explained and it leaves you with a lot of questions.  Above all this, it's still highly entertaining and I am a sucker for a good romance, even though the first episodes exasperated me to no end.  Our  goblin likes to play games with the girl and their silly banter runs the gamut from idiocy to deep tenderness, once the nonsense between them is cleared away and Mr. Goblin realizes he is in love,What makes this drama watchable despite its flaws are the beautiful actors that make up this ensemble.  They are wholly believable, in the moment and completely invested in their characters.  No one does this better than Gong Yoo, our handsome goblin.  His expressive eyes make you feel every emotion emanating from within.  His despair is our despair, his joy makes us feel warm.  (Because of this ability to give himself completely to his role, Gong Yoo has won the top spot in my list of best actors in South Korea.  He is also, in my opinion, the most breathtakingly beautiful man I have ever set eyes on.)   There are some downright hilarious moments and clear messages of friendship, compassion, loyalty and forgiveness.  The soundtrack is amazing.  The songs range from typical pop pieces to some very different sounds which fit the drama perfectly.  I would watch this again just to relive the dreamy spark of Gong Yoo's eyes.

Of course the Goblin is a nearly 1000 year old supernatural being, however there is a difference between this and other supernatural romances with age gaps that make it less acceptable. Firstly, the female lead starts out as *underage*. The actual actors have a 12 year gap and the man looks like he could be her father which makes it much more awkward in the show seeing the male lead essentially watch the female lead as she grows up. I felt so uncomfortable in every scene where she's a highschooler, a literal child, with a grown man the show is hinting at romance with. Regardless if they don't doing anything before she is older, it's strange to wait until it's legal and to even hint at feelings when she is so obviously a child. Unfortunately the interesting main storyline couldn't distract me enough to ignore and enjoy this drama. Yikes.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Okay. Let me tell you this, I am a big Gong Yoo fan. I'm part of the older generation where I get to watch kdramas VCD days. And I've watched all Gong Yoo movies and dramas and knew that he will always be that movie and TV star A-lister.So I watched this while it was still airing and I am already utterly disappointed within a couple of episodes. I already knew what's gonna happen. The pain they're trying to go through for the Tokkaebi to find someone who will actually and finally can kill him. His bride. Nice premise, but you won't get surprised where it took you because it was set up right at the beginning. Even with the characters. The moment Kim Min Jae's character went into the screen, I knew who he is in the present. Because who else would it be? Everything was just so obvious. What really made me held on was of course, Gong Yoo, and the adorbs KGE, although I'm not really in love with the ajusshi thingy. So yes, to give it a chance before going here for ratings, I watched it again, and feelings remained the same, if not even lower. I am so sorry. The cinematography was top-notch.The music was also so so so so good. The scoring. The OST. Main OST was an earworm,But that didn't actually save the drama for me.Will I watch it again?Maybe not.I guess I was really not a fan of writer. Maybe the last drama that I liked from her was Secret Garden, which actually took me three years to finish.

I liked the leads relationship so because of that, I will give this 5/10 even though I think it should be less because it was dragging and boring for most of the 16eps. After watching the whole series, I couldn’t see what the hype/rave reviews was all about except the fact that most of the viewers seem unhealthily obsessed with the two MLs especially with Lee Dong-Wook hence the inflated ratings. This is nowhere near a 8.0 rating much less 8.8 rating, IMO.I swear to God the delusional castle that most K & C Drama fans have built does host a lot of idiotic individuals. People were literally wailing and crying in the VIKI comment section. How the fuck are you wailing and crying in the comment section about Kim Shin putting his hands on the Grim Reaper in Ep13 (let someone kill your whole fucking family and let’s see how well you react when you are face to face with the person, I’m sure you will hug them because OMG *insert sarcasm* they are so handsome and you even got to be friends with them before knowing). This is a fucking tv series you morons. He was not actually trying to kill ya”alls precious Lee Dong-Wook. Like WTF.K & C Drama fans will be all up in their feelings when their so called popular and handsome actors are MLs. They will stay bashing the FLs of these actors (deluding themselves with the rhetoric that she can’t act, she’s whiny/clingy or because they feel that she’s not good enough to costar with their precious Male actors) but the MLs are always beyond perfect and above reproach and can apparently do no wrong. These male actors don’t even need to do much or have any sort of great personality, they just need to be “handsome & hot” and viola they are all perfect in all their ways. As a lady I love me some handsome actors and I can appreciate the good looking ones but some “fans” I don’t even call them that, I call them delusional people who take it way too far, little wonder the poor actors/actresses and idols in China and Korea can’t publicize their relationships because of the unstable people that claim to be their fans….FYI to the above delusional obsessive morons, all your revered male actors won’t read your comments, even if they somehow miraculously do, they won’t care for your trifling thoughts and opinions of them and their FLs, especially when most of them are actual friends with said FLs. So keep wasting your useless time bashing all their FLs in the VIKI comment section, VIKI, Youku, IQIYI etc review sections, here on mydramalist and any other tv series review sites, you will end up just being the one dying of anger and frustration while both FL and ML smile to the bank.People were bashing this shows FL that she was childish and immature, I’m like she’s literally 19yrs old in the show and the MLs were 939yrs and 300yrs and were both acting childish with each other but surprise surprise nobody was bashing them, instead they will praising them, saying how they had such chemistry and people were shipping them (pure insanity). This level of obsessive delusions and inability to have rational/logical thinking because a guy is so “handsome”, lemme tell you, it’s borderline mental. Very unstable behavior.And what makes it worse is that, It’s mostly females that you see bashing this FLs. It’s really horrible what women do to each other just because they want to praise and idolize a “handsome” guy that doesn’t even know they exist.

I have no problem with dramas where there is an age gap between the characters but I have a huge issue when one of them is a minor and the other sees and views them in a romantic way.

When fairy tales meet modern media perfectly. If that is not a good enough hook then I do not know what is, or if my words will persuade you in any manner more. I highly recommend this show. Well-written, well-acted and well-produced, this show leaves you craving more. With episodes averaging 77 minutes long, it will not be over quickly. Once you get invested it will keep you on the hook, at least it did to me. This show holds dear to my heart and completely surpirsed me with the level of fantasy, drama, and romance that it encompasses. Not only did it do all that well, but it was all-around a brilliant piece of art produced by modern media. The show enlightens those of the fairy tales and history of the country whilst also encapsulating a sweet and melodramatic romance that leaves your heart aching for more.'Goblin: The Lonely and Great God' is one of those shows that pop up once in a while that proves the mastery of crafting shows. With such a brilliant cast, story, and production in its belt, it is no surprise that this show was and is a masterpiece. The cinematography along with the soundtrack adds to the beauty of the show. Furthermore, it is no wonder the value and popularity of it, either. It proves the level of craftmanship media production involves and how fairy tales meet modern media in a manner that not only engrosses viewers but enlightens those ignorant of the history and tales of a country. It proves that any old folktale can be reimagined and adapted to the screen for a wider audience. That with the right people with the right skills at the right time it can produce a work of magic. The show centres around a girl, Ji Eun Tak, who can see ghosts and is the self-proclaimed 'Goblin's Bride' who can end his eternal existence on Earth. Kim Shin is the god/goblin that became immortal after his tragic demise in Goryeo (where he was an unbeatable general of the military). The Goblin's life remains a bleak existence as he watches all those he retains a relationship with - die, for that is his punishment. The simple task of returning the Goblin to ash by removing the sword turns convoluted and messy with the emotional bond the pair develop. Neither can comprehend the harsh reality that seeks them nor the involvement of past enemies that push them together and make the once-simple task an almost impossibility.The development of the story and the characters intertwine in a manner that suits the title of a fairy tale. Neither production, writing, or casting of the show was skimped upon - everything was done to an extremely high standard. Along with the side characters, that can often get pushed so far to the side that there is no point in their being, in Golbin that is not the case. We meet three very emotionally empathetic characters that hook the viewer almost as tightly as the main two do; Sunny, Yoo Duk Hwa, and the Grim Reaper. It is the progression of all story beats, minor plots, and the development of the side characters that really step the show up a level. This show when I first went to put it on was not something I thought was going to be brilliant. I thought it was going to be a bog-standard fantasy/drama/romance like most others you see. After the first episode, I still was not convinced - mainly due to the long length of the show and the slight information dump that it gave. But once I persevered I fell in love with it. Golbin left me in tears of joy and sadness. It satiated a craving for a good quality romance that I had not been able to find in a long time. If any show deserves blind faith it is this one. In one word this show is ART. It deserves to be seen even by those who wish to criticise it. I have many bits I could criticise and fault, as with anything. As a writer myself, I can see minor parts that should have been developed and whatnot, but even so, this show was one of the best-written pieces of work I have seen in a long time. It reminds me of why I began writing in the first place and what type of writer I want to be. So if you have the time or the craving for a good show, give it go. It was the perfect piece of media for me. And it might just be for you as well. You never know until you try.  Tee. Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I'm genuinely quite sick and tired of the same old plotlines where there are two leads that are bound to end up together, and two supporting actors who may or may not end up together. Writers continue to churn out these repetitive storylines for mindless entertainment to appeal to lonely, horny, swoony, young (and older) women. Goblin, is just another one of these dramas.I absolutely hated this drama: I actually dropped it halfway around episode 8 and continued with my life for the next 6 months with little intention to return to it. I only forced myself to finish the series so it won't keep showing up in my ""Continue Watching"" list in my Netflix account.Its redeeming qualities are the CGI stuff, and the performance of the supporting actors. I thought their love story was slightly more interesting and bittersweet. I was irked by the weird semblance to the awful Twilight series, where an undead male figure falls in love with a teenage girl. EEEWW. Sorry, no matter how dashing Gong Yoo is (I am one of the few who never found him charismatic), I shudder to think how anyone could find this romantic, even suspending all logic.If you are a newbie into the Korean drama universe, this could be a sample drama for you to let your heartstrings be tugged.

The script and story are brilliant. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. There are a few people who point out the age difference between the main characters. This didn't bother me for a few reasons: 1) There's no romantic chemistry between them until she's older, but I loved the bickering friendship chemistry between them in the early episodes. And her young age at the beginning contributes to the absurdity and therefore comedy. You're not supposed to see adult love between the characters (at the beginning). You see a bickering, frustration, growing respect, empathy, eventual admiration and like between two humans, which is appropriate. 2) The main premise of the story is he's a hundreds-year-old Goblin; you're going to have to be willing to suspend disbelief, people! If the part of the story you're hung up on is the ""age difference"" between a 200+ year old Goblin and the ""bride,"" then that's odd. 3) His character, honestly, wasn't very mature. LOL! I mean, he was old, but his maturity level wasn't commensurate with his age. He seemed petty and kinda tired of life when the show started. He continued to be petty (but less tired) as the show went on. The character was stuck (mentally and emotionally) at the age of his ""death,"" likely 30 or so. That was made very clear.  Thus, she grew up and so did he, eventually coming together when they were similar in mental and emotional age.Second, third, fourth . . . one hundredth, the cast. Holy moly, there has never been a more perfect cast. My Drama List should allow users to apply a ""11 star"" option once. If they did, this show would've received it from me for its casting. Obviously, all the main leads were incredible. This was my first introduction to both Kim Go Eun and Gong Yoo, and I have become a big fan of both. Their chemistry with each other was incredible. Their chemistry with other characters was also incredible. The way they look at each other in later episodes (just look) will give you butterflies. AAAHHH!!The music must be mentioned. This is the first (and only) drama where I still listen to the entire soundtrack. Each song is worth listening to on its own. 10+++ stars for the music. It has become the drama against which all other OSTs are judged.I want to go back to the script for a second. I can't say enough about how great the dialogue was. Obviously, the actors' delivery was essential to bringing it all to life, but some lines / interactions were so brilliant. Funny, poignant, witty, engaging. So good.Direction was good.

"BbalanceD","/profile/BbalanceD","Mar  5, 2022","3","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    Top Drama  I just finished watching the Goblin Special (lots of behind the scenes moments and bloopers) it reminded me how much I loved this drama so I felt compelled to write a review.This drama was outstanding for me. It was directed by the talented Lee Eung Bok and it has a level of plot complexity that really appealed. I was hooked right from the start the music and cinematography brought the standard to a high level. In the early episodes the laugh out loud moments were wonderful and the ML's especially good at the deadpan, fast delivery and comic timing. Special mention: Goblin has the most perfect OST ever!The script writing is excellent apart from the humour there are also some esoteric ideas that are handled well.I felt the pace of the episodes was steady, not too rushed and allowed me to care about what was happening. I felt for the characters and cried buckets over the painful parts. Gong Yoo  makes this drama outstanding (yes I am biased towards every role he has ever played) Kim Shin endures so much and does it with dignity (and a great wardrobe) he has lived over 900 years and never been in love so some of his reactions to the FL  are quite clumsy and youthful. He has been focused on his plan without a thought for the 'goblin bride's involvement so initially comes across as very unfeeling.Kim Go Eun is a brilliant actress and as Ji Eun Tak meets Kim Shin when she is a high school student studying to get into uni. She has led a very sad life with almost no support since aged 9 when her mother died. She is very believable playing this 19 year old who has been told repeatedly she is to become the goblin's bride so she latches onto him very strongly when they meet. Later she plays her own age of 29 and this transition is also well developed.The Grim Reaper (Lee Dong Wook) builds a close friendship with Kim Shin and their antics as flatmates, together with Yoo Duk Hwa  (Yook Sung Jae)  add some of the cutest and lighter humorous elements and assist later when some of the darker history is revealed.The rest of the cast are also stand-out for me. I do think I will rewatch at a later time because there is so much to take in and I must make a special mention that the baddie Park Jung Hun is particularly scary.

"kobeno1","/profile/8046613","Sep 19, 2023","3","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    This review may contain spoilers Breathtaking Love Story About Letting Go of the Past  Ever since I began really getting into K-Dramas, the one series that has eluded me is this one. It wasn’t in the US region, and I’d heard so many things about it that I kept trying to figure out a way to watch it. Fortunately, moving to Taiwan put me in a different Netflix region, and I almost missed it again, because it’s under the title, “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.” My expectations for this series were surpassed in every way. I was slightly worried that the reputation of the series would somehow come up short. It didn’t. This is one of the most charming and transcendent love stories I have ever seen. It’s light, beautiful, and full of laughter and tears. In short, it’s full of Life. And perhaps that is why it has touched the hearts of so many. The four leads of this series are all captivating and you scarcely want to blink for fear of missing something whenever any of them are on screen. Gong Yoo (Kim Shin) has the smoothest, most soft-spoken, and calming voice I think I have ever heard. He reminded me of Cary Grant, one of history's most romantic and effortless actors. He has such charm that he doesn’t have to do much to be in awe of his performance.I haven’t seen Kim Go Eun in many things, but this is easily the most vivacious and endearing role that I have seen her in. She plays Ji Eun Tak to perfection. She has such a lovely smile and bubbly personality that you can easily see why Kim Shin is so taken with her. Despite her hardships, she simply oozes Life itself. Lee Dong Wook, the grim reaper with a past, plays the very heartbroken and wounded soul who somehow senses that he’s done something terrible in his past. I’ve seen this talented actor in several series now. As good as Gong Yoo is at acting with his eyes, Lee Dong Wook shows us every ounce of pain that his character is going through. We feel it. We eventually know of the horrendous things he’s done, but in the end, all we want is for him to let go of the pain. Finally, we have Yoo In Na, an actress I have only seen one other time in “Touch Your Heart.” She is such a charmer with that incredible smile of hers and her very youthful expressions. Only Yoo In Na can take a somewhat conceited character and make her likable and pleasing. She did the same in “Touch Your Heart” and it’s obviously something she’s a master at doing. In many ways, she’s a character who’s torn between the Goblin and the Reaper, and we somehow sense that she knows this. Perhaps that it also why, despite the pain of the past, she’s the strongest of the three because she’s actually able to let go.While this is an absolutely endearing love story, the series’ power is its message of forgiveness. Everyone carries baggage around, holding on to the painful experiences of the past with the weights of guilt and shame for the things we’ve done. For the Goblin, this is represented by the sword. For Sunny, it’s the ring. And for the Grim Reaper, it’s his hat. And the glue that binds them, with the wisdom of living a free and carefree life, is Ji Eun Tak. How long must people continue to suffer before we let ourselves and others off the hook? Punishment does not come from anyone or anything except for ourselves. So, how long will you continue to carry the burden? Release lies in the wisdom and power of forgiveness, which is the process of letting go. Leave all of your burdens behind. The music of this series mirrors the series itself with light piano pieces and soft songs that always seem to mirror the story, the characters, and even the environment. I loved how part of the series was filmed in Quebec, obviously during the fall season when the scenery is at its most captivating. The series doesn’t miss a beat with some outrageously hilarious moments. One of my favorites was when the Goblin and the Reaper are trying to figure out how to use a cell phone and the camera that goes with it. Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook had me laughing so hard during that scene! It was priceless. Korean performers are masters of emotion. The tears that were shed were so powerful and convincing by all four actors, that it had you really feeling those moments of sadness and pain. That is what separates Korean actors from so many others: they make you FEEL it! When Ji Eun Tak loses the Goblin, and she begins to wail uncontrollably on the rooftop, you can’t help but feel her pain and despair. The same happens for the Goblin in the last episode. But alas, all is not lost. No one goes away forever, and that is another aspect of the story that is truly beautiful and what made that final scene so epic. Goblin is easily one of the best series I’ve ever seen, and at some point, I will certainly wish to sit down and watch it again. Goblin is like sitting at home under a warm blanket, drinking a cup of hot coffee in front of a fireplace while the autumn leaves fall outside in the crisp air with the reminder to enjoy Life and each moment.

I was expecting to be disappointed by it as there is too much hype around this drama and that always leads to a rise in expectations. However after completing it, I can say that I totally understand the hype but not without its issues.I will start with the good:-Honestly at the heart of the show is the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper. They have a definite backstory and a connection that we see blossom as the two rely on each other and grow fond of one another. -Grim Reaper. Yes. That is it. With the most interesting character arc, all the plot lines surrounding him were the most engaging and I would always look forward to his scenes.-The romance between Sunny and the Grim Reaper is heartbreaking and endearing. They have great chemistry  and I could totally see why Touch your Heart was made after this show. -Strong supporting cast that added to the drama instead of working as an unnecessary filler. Each character had something to add in their own way. -The humorous parts were well-placed and would help bring a lighter tone after heavy scenes. -OST. The show is known to have a great soundtrack and it honestly contributes in making this drama better.-Spot on acting by each member of the cast. -Last but not definitely not the least, its outstanding cinematography. The colors and locations are just super pleasing to the eye. There were certain illogical points in the plotline but I won't include any plot-related point in my dislike area. Now coming to my share of problems:-THE MAIN COUPLE. Just like a few others have mentioned, the age gap here is very hard to ignore. And no, I am not referring to the age gap between the actors; the fact that a 900+ year old Goblin falls for a high school student just did not sit well with me. Their relationship at many points seemed more like a father-daughter duo, with him patting her head, buying her gifts as she squeaks and gets excited, telling her to be back home early and on time, paying for her meals- the list just goes on. It certainly did not help that Eun Tak was written as an innocent, bubbly young teenager and the 'wise' Goblin too lost all his  composure around her. The actors of course nailed their parts so this is not on them but just on how the central love story was written. Even till the end, the weakest link for me was their romance plot line. They did have their moments, but that left a very temporary smile on my face unlike the second couple. -Repeated scenarios, too many flashbacks and heck lot of slow motion shots (particularly between the Goblin and Eun Tak). I know all dramas have these, but this one takes it to another level. -Lack of screen time for Yoo Duk Hwa and Sunny. These were two very interesting characters which in spite of being a part of the main cast were underutilized in my opinion. -A lot of the essential and heavy stuff was revealed and given light to after episode 10 (with earlier episodes having repeated scenarios and flashbacks as mentioned above). One might wonder in spite of not enjoying the main romance  how could the rating still be an 8? Well even with my personal problems with it, there were many factors that kept me going and I was invested in the show. I was also very pleased with how the show ended. If you want to watch, give it a try. But if the main couple's interactions bother you in the start, it does not get better. If you can get past it, then there is the epic bromance and the second lead's love story. If the romance fits your bill, then the show will be extremely enjoyable for you.

Acting of the cast was up to standards, however I found the age difference between Kim Shin (Gong Yoo) and Ji Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun) bothersome and somehow found the secondary love couple more interesting; Grim Reaper (Lee Dong Wook) and Sunny (Yoo In Na). Goblin's Music was top notch. Enjoyed it very much with these beautiful songs out there. Now you can disregard my rewatch value ranking as I am absolutely not fan of rewatching series, cause the story is spoiled once you know most of it already.

Goblin. Everyones known drama Goblin. Bet there is no person who has not heard that title. Grew my curiosity as well, began it, and couldnt really see what people would brag about this drama so much. So i thought to myself its just me. The romance was a bit weird to me at first the age gap would make me kinda uncomfortable since Ji Eun Tak would act a bit childish even tho she was a 19 year old woman.  She was so demanding and clingy and the way she would talk annoyed  me a lot. And as a person who doesnt enjoy comedy dramas the first episodes were i guess i should say, boring. I found myself  skipping scenes a lot . Yet i didnt drop it. Thankfully. Even tho i thought about it a lot. When the story began getting explained and when  things finally got more serious i realised why people love this drama. Its way more deep than it seems in the first approximentally 8-9 episodes. And it turned out that even the funny awkward moments this couple went through, had a very huge impact on them once seperated. The music is obviously the best and it only makes things more emotional just how it should. The ending was kinda sad to me because Goblin doesnt age and hes still immortal which means hes gonna witness Eun Taks death again and again and if she actually has 4 lives there will be a moment where she wont be able to be born again and that is one hella sad thought i just had. I am happy i didnt drop it even tho I'll definitely never watch it again. It was a nice story considering I love historical dramas. If there weren't that many unnecessary scenes I would have had a better opinion on this drama.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"palmington","/profile/palmington","Oct 12, 2022","2","6.0","Overall 6.0    Story 7.0 Acting/Cast 8.0 Music 10 Rewatch Value 5.0    Personally, I was expecting to fall in love with this drama but that sadly didn't happen.   The production, score, and acting were SO well done and the backstory in the first episode made me very excited to watch this drama. But, I could not get behind the main couple. Firstly, the age gap b/w the ML + FL was so vast that it made it hard to believe their relationship would ever work.  I felt like the FL lacked most appealing qualities - since she was young for most of the drama, she came off as very whiny + immature which was a weird contrast w/ the ML who is much older than her (not to say he was incredibly mature, but there's def a difference in how the FL + ML handle situations). I found the chemistry lacking and honestly just didn't care about their story line once I reached episode 8 (as far as the relationship goes; however, the background of the life of the ML and the lore was interesting). The secondary couple was MUCH more interesting and I really focused on their parts - the chemistry was there and it was much more believable that they would be together. I must say, the relationship between the two male leads was SO good - well acted + the friendship was incredible. Don't recommend beyond watching it for than the production.

"Naomi Necro","/profile/naominecro","Oct 18, 2021","2","8.5","Overall 8.5    Story 8.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.0    This review may contain spoilers   This was my first introduction to Gong Yoo and I can easily understand why he's so loved. He's gorgeous, emotive, and captivating in his scenes. This series easily had one of the strongest openings I've ever watched. The first few episodes hooked me in with its OST, masterful cinematography, special effects, and script. I loved the backstory and how it explained the Goblin's origin in a way that made me think of old bedtime stories, or even a Guillermo del Toro opener.  I was curious and enamored by Goblin right away. The show isn't perfect. I wouldn't say it's ""over-hyped"" like some of the other reviews say, but I do feel like the show had some issues that even made me skip through a bit with the last couple of episodes.  The pacing was a huge issue. It became very obvious by episode 7 or 8 that the show lacked its main antagonist. That could have easily been remedied by introducing the evil spirit a lot sooner (and with less Halloween-y makeup) and less meandering with the ""will she or won't she"" pull the sword out. I also had an issue with the age gap.  I had the same issue in My Roommate is a Gumiho. Why must the writers use a minor to captivate the heart of our 900+year-old protagonist? Ick, guys.  Even making her college-age at their intro would have been a whole lot better (maybe mid-20s?). Her maturity level and the school uniform constantly gave me the creeps whenever he looked at her in a romantic way (although, I'll give the series credit that they waited until she was technically legal until he made any physical move on her...but still, ick! 900 vs just-legal. What is this, a Pornhub storyline?)I was able to suspend disbelief a little bit ONLY because I knew the RL actress was actually 26 (to Gong's 38 - which is still a bit much, but still totally acceptable and not 19yr old vs 900+).   Kim Byung Chul bothered me a lot.  His character, Park Joong Hun, was ultra campy in both appearance and behavior as an evil spirit. I assumed it was due to poor writing (which came as a surprise because the writing was excellent up until then). He was a lot more sinister in his introduction as he whispers into the king's ear. He seemed formidable and insidious. I loved the bromance and the humor that the show inserted to give moments levity. I didn't really like the Cinderella syndrome our FL had with her constant need to summon Goblin to solve her problems instead of fight back and out of her own dilemmas (even though it was always fun watching him come to her rescue or show up disoriented and caught off guard). The ending was bittersweet for me with respect to Goblin's fate, but knowing he's no longer existing purely because of his punishment tells me he'll leave with her once she's lived through her 4th life, so in that respect it was beautifully written. Despite its issues, I was sad to finish the show. I'm having a hard time finding something else to watch that matches even close.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Despite the drama ends with a happy notes to all the characters, the ‘happy ending’ leave a bitter taste in my mouth tbh. Kim Eun Sook made Shin such a sad, pitiful and full of misery as a character. All he ever did from the beginning right until the end is waiting and waiting. He waited 900 years for his bride, he then waited another 9 years in coldness and nothingness yearning and trying to get back to her, and at the end, he waited another 60++ lonely years waiting for her to be reborn again. What kind of lonely and sad fate is that? There’s nothing cool or poetic about it. The writer just want to make the ending more ~dramatic~ but it turned flat instead.But despite the bittersweet ending, I love the drama as a whole. It did have its flaws and questionable plot line like Eun Tak being a 19 years old high school student but the drama as a whole is hilarious and has amazing cinematography consistently throughout. It was beautifully shot in all angles but I do feel it is so slow sometimes. I still cant believe that this is the same writer who wrote the disappointing 'The Heirs’ and the embarrassing 'Descendant of the Sun’. I just cant believe that the same writer is capable of writing such a good drama like this. Her usual style of writing which focuses on pop-culture references (Eun Tak asking Grim Reaper to name himself Park Bo Gum which means 'Precious Sword’ to tease Shin was brilliant), amazing bromance between the male leads and interesting 2nd leads’ love story can be seen in this drama but somehow she has upped her game when she wrote Goblin – its like she has matured in her writing style which is very surprising and unexpected.I thought Gong Yoo did an excellent job as Kim Shin. His loneliness, sadness, sad smiles and  happiness can be felt when you see him on screen. I understood Shin’s loneliness and desperation clearly and all of this thanks to Gong Yoo amazing portrayal. Many people have complain with Kim Go Eun as Eun Tak but I really like her. If other actress is playing this role, I would definitely find them annoying but Go Eun played this role naturally. Her crying scenes are amazing and as usual, she always play all of her movies/dramas’ characters differently each and everytime. Whatever wrong decision or bad acting Lee Dong Wook made in the past (ehem Hotel King ehem Blade Man) is redeemed in this drama. I feel like I cry with him everytime he looks at Sunny and all the sadness he feels inside. I don’t know he has it in him so I’m mildly surprise. And what can I say about Yoo In Na? She just look extremely gorgeous in this drama. Her hair flip, lips, and everything just look totally beautiful and her monologue when she is writing the letter to the radio shattered me. Sung Jae as Yoo Deok Hwa (reference to Andy Lau and Infernal Affairs) is just hilarious. He’s my fave character in the show and he got the best scenes in the whole drama hands down. I’m so proud of him!Generally, I just dislike this whole next life/reincarnation thingie. It made people didn’t live their live to the fullest with the hope of meeting each other again in their next life. Its your own life, you can control it so throw all of it out of the window and be happy. You don’t have to live a lonely life longing for each other and hope that your next life will be better – I’m looking at you Wang Yeo and Sunny. But despite that, I found its interesting how their love starts. While Shin and Eun Tak rely heavily on destiny (her as his bride) and memory, Wang Yeo and Sunny will fall in love with each other at first sight each and everytime. No matter which life times, they just attracted at each other without any reasons at all – that 'one look’ sealed all the deals for them.What I find most interesting while watching this drama is that the ability of it to made me shed tears many times. I just randomly shed tears at random scenes or at random script. I cried a lot watching episodes 15 & 16 which is crazy lol. I shed tears at the blind man and his dog, the soldier and his wife and at other random scenes. And the scene of Wang Yeo meeting Sunny after 9 years, Sunny’s letter or when Eun Tak remembering back all her memories, all of it made me cry like a baby. I certainly didn’t expect all of this. Due to this fact alone, I give the drama 8/10. The drama has its flaws (King & Queen underdeveloped relationship, everyone reincarnated with the same face, everything still look the same even after 100++ years has passed & etc…) but the good feelings it gave is unforgettable and as much as I hate to admit it, the script has many magic lines and it just worked in the right scene and at the right time.The OSTs hasn’t impressed me much truthfully. But I totally love Crush’s Beautiful, Urban Zakapa’s Wish & Han Soo Ji’s Round & Round. Beautiful & Wish are melancholy beautiful (with awesome lyrics) and upon watching the MVs after the drama ended, I just realized how the drama has so many sad scenes. :(  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The opening episodes sucked me in with the incredible atmosphere and pacing, and the chemistry between the second leads was chef’s kiss. But I have some serious gripes with the story and the main characters that made me feel like I was on a rollercoaster with a broken seatbelt.The Main Leads: Confusing at Best, Cringe at WorstThe Male Lead is… Old, but Also a Child?I mean, come on. He’s ancient—very, VERY old. Like, we’re talking multiple centuries of experience here. But somehow, he acts like a confused teenager. When he was a soldier, the guy was calm, calculating, and cool. But fast forward to his immortal life, and he turns into this soft, awkward mess. What happened? Did immortality give him eternal wisdom or just eternal awkwardness?The Female Lead is Just… Odd.Okay, she’s totally cool with some random guy popping out of nowhere with magical powers?

I get suspension of disbelief, but come on.Nitpicks & The Stuff I LovedThe music? Amazing. It fits the tone so perfectly that I’m still humming it at random moments.Honestly, I would’ve preferred a show focused on the Grim Reapers. That storyline had much more potential than what we got. The second leads? Gold. I wanted more episodes just to dive deeper into their characters and give them the impact they deserved.When the Wheels Fell OffThe first 10 episodes? I was hooked—completely in. But then came the moment when the female lead tries to run away from the male lead, and wow. That scene was so cringe I almost threw my remote. I get that they were going for emotional conflict, but it just came off as forced and awkward.Final ThoughtsThis show had everything going for it—fantastic production, music, and promising side characters. But the confusing behavior of the main leads and some awkward story moments derailed it for me. If it had focused more on the second leads or the Grim Reapers, I think this could’ve been legendary. Still, it’s worth a watch, just don’t be surprised if you find yourself cringing here and there.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

It is more than worth the 23 hours of entertainment. Honestly... I went back and forth about whether or not I should actually watch this drama but I kept seeing it's name mentioned in articles related to Asian dramas or list of dramas to watch or something near to that, so I thought... let's give it a shot and see what happens. Let me tell you, this show had me on the edge of my seat for the two days I took to watch it, Now I'm sorry I didn't watch it months ago when I first saw it. The plot, the actors, the settings, the music... everything was on point. I started crying and laughing from as early as episode one. That right there is a good indication of whether or not a drama will be good. If it can have you in tears within the first hour that more than says something.  I see and hear people complaining about the age gap between the male and female leads and I really don't see anything wrong with it. Maybe it's because I live in the west where most persons are considered to be adults by age 18. At the start of the series the female lead is 19 and in my country I had friends who were married at that age. In the drama nothing serious happened until the female lead was 20, which is the age of an adult in South Korea and the kisses didn't get steamy and heavy until she was a lot older. All in all this drama is a must watch. You won't regret it.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

An emotionally compelling story. Stunning and visually appealing cinematography. An OST that's still highly regarded in today's time and complements the screenplay perfectly. The cast have a clear chemistry with one another and do justice to their characters and the writing.So, what's wrong? Let me preface this with, I have zero, absolutely zero issues with actor or character age gaps whether physical or theoretical. Chemistry and acting chops over everything. If you can sell sand to a beach, I'm in. But something was off with the main ""couple"" in this show. The male lead and female lead just didn't click for me. They gave off a father/daughter dynamic as opposed to romantic interests. And as hard as the show pushed this relationship I just wasn't convinced. K-Drama fans love buying up fairytale romances so that's exactly what Goblin sold--- alongside those product placements, amirite?I'm also very much in the opinion that the best parts of the show were the Goblin-Reaper (male leads) relationship and banter. Scenes that included those two generally meant a good time for the viewers and was strong enough to magnify any other characters in the scene. The show also went through a lot of ""not much is happening"" sequences and with the romantic aspects being more of the bittersweet, ill-fated variety there wasn't much left in the tank in terms of substance.And as much as an emotionally-charged cluster bomb the ending sequences were, I thought it was both fine and fitting for all of the characters and especially for Mr. Goblin--- Guardian, the lonely and great god.

"Aya97","/profile/Aya97","Mar 24, 2017","4","9.5","Overall 9.5    Story 8.5 Acting/Cast 9.5 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.0      There are some things you need to know before giving this drama a go - it's slow paced but not really - confusing right? What I mean is that the loveline itself is progressing rather normally, except that you don't have the typical love-rival that tends to get on your nerves or gives you second-lead syndrome. Its slowness comes in the developing of the story, as the conflict appears pretty late. But, if you were to ask me, I kind of enjoyed the way it was structured, it gave me time to process everything and really immerse myself in the plot.  Also, I was quite surprised with the characters. In spite of the hate that the main couple receives because of their 12 year difference, I kind of get where the writer was going. Also I didn't find the relationship between the 2 awkward, and I loved the fact that Eun Tak acted as her age and didn't try to be more mature, despite of what she has gone through in her life. I was a big fan of her character and her positive and brave personality, the fact that she didn't hide her feelings for the Goblin was quite fresh and helped in avoiding not needed drama to the series.  In my case, I love the Grim Reaper the most. Also his character is the most interesting one in whole bunch. Lee Dong Wook is such a talented actor, especially when it comes to emotional scenes, he has one of the best crying faces in the industry. I love the complex story that surrounded his character and how he comes in term with it.   Goblin is really a beautiful drama. It deals with reincarnation, a theme that is not really used, and if it is, usually is some kind of subplot. It's interesting to see how souls can recognize each other, and how there stories can tangle up again and again. It will make you curious of your own world, our world, and make you think of moments that maybe you felt and instant connection with someone. It may be fantasy but who really knows, reality is that we ourselves don't know the mysteries that are attached to life and death or what is beyond it.   I recommend you to watch this drama with an open heart, ready to be surprised and question it. Truth is we all like some miracles in our life, and this drama is good in that aspect, it is full of miracles and topics that weren't discussed before.  So enjoy the ride and let it make you fall in love with it and its characters!

At the first episodes I found her irritating but then I get used to her.   The story is interesting and keeps you wondering about what's gonna happen next.   I will probably watch another drama of GY but I do not think that I'll watch one of KGE dramas.  I have watched Train to Busan and he is very talented.   while watching there is one thing might irritate you that is the great age difference betw Goblin & ET.   That love things in the edge of being a pedapholie   Goblin is a man who is over 900 yrs old but looks like a man who is in his late 30's early 40's while ET is only 19 yrs old and a high schooler. She is inlove with a man who is  at the age of her dad / can be easily have / had kids at her age.   And if we think of the era he comes from he possibly might have concubines, wives and a couple of kids.   They are good match physically but in this drama, it was over the border.  I do ship them but not on this drama, they can easily be bf / gf as KGE likes elderly guys and GY likes younger girls.   I was more interested in Sunny and Grim Reaper couple.   they were a fantastic couple.   There were a lot of product placements, from stuff toys, to TBS White Musk Perfume, which I end up buying and now using a room spray as the perfume is that much crap, the watches he wore, canon camera which is worth over £2000 this is with only a small lens.   I only find the Canon placement irritating I thought it was related with the upcoming scenes as they have openly showed us, like poking someone's eye.  it was that obvious.    I really enjoyed the Canada scenes, and a couple of Korea  Seoul scenes but that's it.   I want to see Yoo In Na, LDW, Yook Sung Jae, & Lee El in one drama.   I will not go back & rewatch this drama.  It was one shot for me, I will forget about it within few months.     If it was not KGE as a leading lady, and if there were less flashbacks, less repetitions it would be an excellent drama  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

It handles one of the deepest concepts; death, life, destiny, choices and regrets. And it does a great job with it. It is a very realistic drama, while having fantasy elements(with great special effects) which makes it x100 times better. It has great life stories. And what I mean by life is that it has friendship, family, and great love. It talks about being a human, it talks about learning to love yourself and others. It is funny, it is sad, it is beautiful and every moment of it shines. It is just one the best stories I have ever seen and I wish everyone would get to see this.

"Rurzii","/profile/Rurzii","Jan 22, 2017","6","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Okay, I'll start by letting you know that among all the dramas I've watched, even though I had favorites, I never felt the need to post a review. So this is my first time. Goblin was just AMAZING, that I felt like I was committing a grave mistake by not reviewing it and letting everyone know how amazing it really is. Furthermore, this is also my very first time rating a drama a whole 10. Not because they weren't amazing, nor was it because I felt like they didn't deserve it, just purely because I felt like no drama can ever get a whole 10. It felt impossible to me. However, as you guys can clearly see, I gave Goblin a 10. This speaks volumes of this drama. Even my drama hating hubby, decided to give this one a shot after glimpsing a scene of it while I was watching one of the earlier episodes.  Story: The story line was spectacular, the idea in itself was original. I've never watched anything remotely close to Goblin's story line. The way everything was timed and spaced was perfect, I never felt like there was a moment of boredom. The plot, the poems, the scenes, the cinematography, my god, the cinematography was pure bliss. It really shows the amount of work and thinking that went into this production. Even the ending, - I won't go into detail with that, as not to spoil it for the people who haven't watched it yet - this was one of the very few dramas that wrapped up the ending very well. Even though it was bittersweet, it just felt right and made total sense. There wasn't anything that was over the top or thrown in together just to satisfy the audience even though it makes no sense whatsoever. There was Romance, Comedy and Suspense weaved in together perfectly. Cheers to the writer and producer.  Acting/Cast: I've read a few comments here and there while the drama was still airing. Some people found the relationship between the Goblin and Eun Tak disturbing because of the large age gap (939 years), but if you think about it, it wouldn't have made sense for them to just meet for the first time when she was older. He's been living for the past 900 years, so his bride was bound to be born sometime throughout his lifetime and she is bound to be much younger than him. Also, the production team limited the relationship between the Goblin and the younger Eun Tak to cutesy and adorable moments. There was nothing immoral about it. So if anyone is hesitating to watch this drama because of this issue then fear not. I felt like the cast did an amazing job. Each actor and actress portrayed their characters in a way that made me laugh and cry with them. I felt each person's sorrow and pain. Even the chemistry between them was amazing. The Bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper was mind blowing. I feel like if it weren't for this specific cast, the story line wouldn't have been portrayed as seamlessly as it had been. SO, Cheers to the cast as well.  Music: The OST was superb. You won't be able to prevent yourself from repeatedly playing the songs on a loop. Whenever I was waiting for the next episode to air, I would just play the OST and reminisce on the previous scenes.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

EVERYTHING! ????? :')  This drama now holds a special place in my heart! It may even be my new #1 fav drama, especially since it's in the supernatural/fantasy/romance genre, which is my fav! The drama gave me great feelings, especially from the characters (and I must say that this drama has the BEST freaking bromance ever!!!). I'd watch BTS of Goblin with Lee Dong Wook and Gong Yoo and they were just an amazing pair. Adding Sung Jae to the mix made it even better. Hahahaha xD The 3 were a riot! ???  I laughed and I was happy. I cried and I felt pain. There was never a dull moment watching this drama, each episode better than the previous. I never skipped an episode, nor did I fast forward anything. Everything about this drama was absolutely stunning. ? The plot (which was somewhat heartbreaking yet beautiful), the characters and their personalities, to the amazing cinematography(which look like it took you to a whole new world), even down the the music (OST). ?  I loved the main characters so much. My ships ??~ It's funny cos at one point, I shipped the Goblin and the Reaper! Hahahaha xD Those two kill me!  Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak was so adorable and smart. I loved how enthusiastic her character was. She's been thru so much and she was still able to smile and be optimistically cheerful and always helped people even when she's going thru stuff. She has such a kind soul. Yoo In Na as Sunny was awesome. She was sassy, beautiful and radiant, like the Sun! ^^ Yook Sung Jae as Yoo Deok Hwa made the whole bromance better. Hahahaha xD I love how they'd tease him sometimes and he'd get mad and frustrated. Hahahaha xD His character was a blessing to the drama, not gonna lie.  I loved how all their lives were intertwined with each other and the twist that came with it all.  There were certain things that would happen that you would not expect and you're just like, @#$%! Lol I loved the beautiful, breathtaking, heartwarming, heartbreaking, sizzling hot chemistry between the couples. Most complain about the age difference. Who gives AF? They're all adults so it doesn't matter. I didn't think about that when I was watching the drama. The chemistry was there and it was just perfect! ???? I was enjoying it too much to care. lol~  The soundtrack is just wonderful to listen to and very catchy. I don't know how they do it but it's just amazing. OMG! Some of the songs gave me feels and not just because of the scenes they'd play it with, but if you actually listen to some of the songs, it resonated something within you. ???  I waited for this drama patiently and with high hopes and I was not disappointed one bit. My expectations were exceeded. ????? Were there any flaws? Cos if there were I can't think of a single thing At least to me there wasn't any. A perfect 10/10! I commend the writers for doing such an excellent job with this drama!  The rewatch value is EXTREMELY high for me, because best believe I will download every single episode and rewatch it again and I will definitely download the entire soundtrack and listen to it on repeat. Goblin is a must watch~ You will not regret it! :') ? If you do decide to give this drama a shot, I truly hope you enjoy watching! ^^  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"MariliaRoquini","/profile/mariliaroquini","Jan 22, 2017","7","10","Overall 10    Story 9.5 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      This may come as a surprise but when Globin started airing, I had no interest in watching it. Let’s say I love Asian Culture and entertainment, that is why I watch dramas but one thing is true, Asians are not good in doing description and to me Goblin sounded lame, over de top fantasy/comedy. I can say for sure that none of those words above can be used to describe it in the end. There has been a long time since a drama moved me in such a way like this one. It is a touching and sincere love story and have the one thing I love the most about romance, it being drama, movie or book. Goblin has “great love”. For the ones who doesn’t know, “great love”  is that genuine love that the person is capable of sacrificing everything for the other one, without selfishness or jealousy or greed. It is just pure love and it is great. Many love stories try this line but few achieve it, Goblin does. If you are reading this, you probable already read de description on the top of the page, it is terrible so let me tell you. This drama is the story of a goblin, a darned creature, who was crushed to walk on earth forever and see all his loved ones die. The only person capable of ending this curse, so he can go to ashes, is his bride. So he goes on waiting  for the bride to appear. That’s all you need to know.  It is beautifully made, the tempo of all drama is well done, none of it gets boring, in the end of each episode you will die wanting more. For the drama veterans, it don’t have almost any clichés of Korean dramas, no second league guy, no annoying girl, no mother in low or and to me it fells new and refreshing. It has one thing that is cliché but this one is to you to find out. And the acting, I can say that Goblin revived a lot of carriers and impulse new ones, for sure. Gong Yoo as Kim Shin was a gift to me, it had been such a long time I watched and loved a drama with him. I love Coffee Prince, and I love him on Coffee Prince. So to me watch him doing so good as the Goblin makes me really pound. Kim Go Eum was a nice surprise, I watched some episodes of Cheese in a Trap, but I didn’t finished it  so I couldn’t tell mush of her background, in Goblin she is refreshing and funny and a strong female lead, you can relate to her and both of them together is explosive . In the beginning I thought the age difference between the characters would make it a little weird, not because the Goblin has more than 900 years, but Gong Yoo is in this late 30’s and Ji Eum Tak is in high school. She even calls him “ajushi”, but you buy it and you buy their love, by the way, she is over eighteen. For the second roles, Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper was other acting as was really happy to see revived, he was not long gone like Gong Yoo but the last few years I was happier watching him in Roommate than in a drama, and it is sad. But he did so well in Goblin that I hope the next drama he does are the same incredible. Yoo In Na, Sunny, did also an amazing job, I don’t know if I’m being mean but seems like In Na has a face of a mean lead but do so much well as second one, not saying she is not talented but she did so well in this character that I want to see her do it again. One very important point I have to talk about is the Grim Reaper and Sunny story line. Technically is the second story line but it is so well treated here that it feels like main one. The two story lines need each other to be excellent and neither of them feels less because of it. It is something really hard to do in story telling. So applause to the Globin team for archiving it.  About the sound track, “Never far Away” is my favorite music high now. I listen to it 5 or 6 times a day. So it is enough to say I love it and if someone say it is not good, they are crazy. The rest of the songs too, are amazing. And about the end, it is something very important to me in a drama. It can break or make the drama for me. There was so many drama that went down on ranking to me because of bad ending, I was afraid this one would too. It didn’t. The end is not fairytale, it is not necessary happy… it is beater sweet I would say, but it is as much of beautifully made as the rest of the drama. And now if I think about it, for the entire drama there was clues of the end, you just don’t realize it. So, you may be wondering why my score was 9,5 and not a 10 if I liked it so much. Well, even if it was an amazing drama, there were some questions and inexplicable aspects that this drama didn’t answer. Things that I found out in the internet but it was the drama that had to give me it, but how it was nothing major I just took 0,5 a point. Overall Goblin is a jewel, worth of watching at least one time or three or four. I’m for sure coming back and watching it again.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Sometimes I just think to myself that some dramas have high ratings because of the famous actors in it, and less about the story. Terrible story this was me thinks. Just my opinion, I actually even dropped it after 5th episode. If you want to watch realistic and(Or) brilliant dramas with good stories then I recommend gems such as Tunnel, Defendant, Ghost and these things. These are the real deal, u hear what am saying.

Another one that didn't enchant me. I've been stalling on this for ages, finally after getting back into kdrama gave this a watch and I am not in love. Yet? I dont know....10 eps in, probably not.Gong Yoo isnt enough to keep me going, the Reaper I find more annoying than interesting, the ""bromance"" as some reviewers call it is not something I see at all, mainly because the reaper seems particularly lifeless to me. Didn't like the actors looks in this either, sinister in his suit, too boyband-like without. (Might be my hatred of korean forehead hiding mushroom haircut tho, dunno)I don't mind the age gap between the leads but I have to second another reviewer's view that they seem more like father/daughter than a romantic prospect. Can't really get into it.Later when they kiss I felt really weirded out tbh, almost like watching siblings kiss. The whole thing is just so rushed, like, she meets him, declares her love and just like that, bc she is the bride of the goblin suddenly he loves her and she loves him, this dude she barely knows, just met and has not a single thing in common with? What?She's a pretty girl, that actress, but smiling and waving at her ""lover"" like a 7yo kid is just way too nope for me. The music was engaging so far, I especially like the score/instrumental parts.The plot itself could've given way to so much more than we got delivered. It was all very inconsistent to me, there are parts throughout almost every episode so far that bored me into playing with my phone instead of watching while others held my interest like a thriller. This might have benefited from not trying to be funny and comedic all the time but instead focusing on the dramatic/sad parts of eternal life and everyday death. The scenes whenever Reaper picked up souls were all really heartbreaking, how average people are ripped out of life, just like that...or how a fallen cyclist can cause that much damage....ouch! Instead the drama seems to focus on establishing and selling a romance that is anaemic and forced at best. And for me, that's really all there is to this. I found myself most attentive during the parts that played in the past (the manipulative magistrate, the sister and the mislead king, all these were more interesting to me than Reaper and Sunny), and I will stop watching after ep 10 because I am bored. So bored.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I just want to say exactly what I felt. This show is downright one of the most beautiful things you'll ever see. From the casting, to the cinematography, to the writing, everything is sheer perfection. It's kind of EPIC. You can feel the beautiful way the creator sees the world, with its particular touch of darkness. It will hurt you, and make you laugh, even in the midst of your pain, like the Grim Reaper in that one scene, you'll not have a choice. Rating the show the highest possible rating wasn’t even up for debate. The thing about a good story is that you can have a massive budget and top rated actors but if you have a stale, unworthy story and half boiled characters, it just doesn't work. The value of this show is that every character is so deep, so believable, so REAL, you can't help getting lost in them. Few minor gripes I have was that Duek Hwa and Jung Hae In should have had better storylines. Second, toward the end the amnesia bit dragged a bit for me. (Minor spoiler) Even the whole finding love in past lives instead of present was again a bit typical for a show of this caliber. What you can do in a next life you can do in this one, for this reason the last two or three episodes in places it got a bit boring for me. Still, I'm happy to have seen this show, I've never quite seen anything like it. All in all, bravo!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I just want to start of by saying that Goblin is a really sad drama . I just want to put that out there because all the top comments and reviews out  there on the World Wide Web rave on in a fan girl manner that you would think it’s Boys Over Flowers . I was misled and the sadness genuinely caught me off guard. It’s SAD. Now that’s out of the way - let me address why I give it a begrudging 9/10. Goblin did not convince me at all that it is a perfect show.  It’s age gap and high school lead was really uncomfortable for me to fathom .Why did they have to make her into a high school kid though ? And though Gong Yoo is hot and all ; he really looked considerably older than his female lead and that was just uncomfortable. But that’s an internal personal bias and has nothing to do with the plot unraveling . Creep factor aside - this was a really original story with an interesting and dare I say new premise. I admired how the writers stayed true to their intentions and you could tell they never fell off but kept focused . It had great quotes too and I loved the deity aspect of the show - it gave it a divine elegance.However - This is a tricky review to write because as a romantic drama - it ticks all the right boxes . Great sweeping love declaration scenes ? Yes . In fact they are touching. Angst ? Yes - sure to cry like a baby . Great supporting leads with equally engaging angsty story lines ? Yes , yes and yes. Great romantic kissing scenes ? Yes.But nooo. It’s not a 10 . The plot was not tight enough . It was repetitive using the same set ups over and over again that it actually wasted time in setting up other important relationships such as the supporting leads relationship progression and the reincarnated relationships that were discovered along the line. Kudos though to the plot twists which were very much appreciated. Sure to keep a viewer tuning in.It also had time in its 16 episodes with rich story to insert a villain which I thought was deft. I also liked the way they handled the past informing the present and the notion of reincarnation and it’s supporting motifs. The romances were also lovely. Emotional resonance was very strong too. I cried like a baby in Ep 13 which is one of the best moments in tv history . The last episode was so poignantly sad too. Comedy was also very well done .The acting and cast were unblemished . Gong Yoo was so funny and melancholy at the same time . The Grim Reaper was gorgeous and grim at the same time and the female leads were assertive , spunky yet passionate in the same this showThe soundtrack is quite possibly one of the best of the best and does much to bolster the ratings . I loved every song and my standouts were Beautiful Life , Hush ( Goblin lullaby, the second leads song I miss You , I Will Go To You Like the First Snow, oh my word - I’m listing the whole sound track ! That’s how good it is !The fashion was off the charts! Deok Hwa’s coats and suits , Grim Reaper’s cozy oversized sweaters and Goblin’s coats were amazing! Sunny’s outfits are worthy of a Pinterest board alone.Rewatch value is quite strong once I get over the creep factor . Souls are apparently immortal and ageless right ? So we will stick with that and suck it up ...As for the OVERALL - don’t waste anymore time and go ahead and watch it ! If there’s anything this show convinced  me of other than a sad love of a lonely and great god Is that it’s definitely one of those shows you need to have under your belt for posterity reasons . Also ,If you loved My Love From the Star , you will surely find this pleasant too. If you like some supernatural and super sadness then this one is for you .

The story was beautiful from start to finish and to the director and scriptwriter this deserved all the praise it received in 2016..I will watch it again.Sending love from the UK.. ❤️ X  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

This drama is easily one of my Top Favorites, no matter how many times I watch it, I always fall in love all over again and get shattered in the process. This is such a good drama. It packs one hell of a punch! The cast couldn't have been better, they did a phenomenal job with their rolls. The soundtrack was great! This story is a tragic one, it will have you on the edge of your seat so consumed by the lives of each character and trying to unravel the past and find the connections to the present. Some would call this is an age gap romance. Our male lead is guardian god (a Goblin) has been living since with an immortal curse for the past 939 years, the only one who can release him from his life of immortality is the Goblin's Bride.  Knowing that you should be prepared for an emotional rollercoaster! Our little bride is a 20 year old girl who has lived a very hard, exhausting, sad life. When our two cross paths it's a hilariously beautiful and bittersweet thing. I was so unprepared. I fell so hard for the Grim Reaper, who is just simply existing, neither alive nor dead, carrying out his duties a punishment   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"The Butterfly","/profile/TheButterfly","Sep 26, 2019","4","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      The two biggest complaints I’ve read about this drama are regarding the age difference and lack of external conflict.  Normally, I’d be right up in the stands blowing raspberries with those people, but not this time.  I watched the one episode that had been English subbed on YouTube and it hit all the pleasure centers in my brain. Being new to the Kdrama world I couldn’t find it on-line and ended up buying it on Amazon. I don’t regret one penny spent on it. StoryI didn’t have a problem with the age difference.  The ML is 939 years old. Anyone under 800 wouldn’t have anything in common with him.  But seriously, the ML and FL have been touched and in their eyes cursed by the supernatural, so these are not two ordinary people.  Most importantly, she is the Goblin’s bride, not wife.  She has one job and I won’t spoil it here but it is not to warm his bed.  He never comes across as some old geezer trying to seduce her.  Even by Kdrama standards, this one is chaste. The Goblin knows what her job is, anticipates and accepts it.  But the moment she brings hope and light into his life the conflict within him and the story explodes.  As he watches her and feels his heart begin to beat again the poetry that springs forth from him was so beautiful it gave my brain a little orgasm. The conflicts in this story are mostly internal but the stakes are high. I usually skim the secondary characters’ stories  because too often they seem like filler and distract from the main storyline. Not this time.   The Reaper’s and Sunny’s stories were seamlessly interwoven and integral to the main story. The bromance between the Goblin and Reaper is legendary so I won’t go into it. I watched every minute of this drama, savoring each one. Forgiveness plays a big role in this story. Our characters find it is not easily earned or given, whether it be for the self, others, or The Powers That Be. ActingThis was my first time for all these actors and I wouldn’t make a single casting change. Gong Yoo did an amazing job as ruthless warrior, tragic guardian angel and Oscar to the Reaper’s Felix. Kim Go Eun did a good job as the girl both afflicted and blessed by her special case.  The secondary characters were all spot on and Lee Dong Wook has to be one of the most beautiful criers in the business. OSTI don’t normally pay attention to the music unless I love it or despise it. The music in Goblin enhanced the story without distracting from it, a difficult task.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. The cinematography was stunning. I had to shush my photographer husband who kept commenting on it. Which brings me to the rewatch value. Rewatch ValueMy husband who has only watched a few scattered episodes of Asian dramas sat down and watched this with me on my second go around. We laughed and cried together (damn allergies!).  I will watch it again. And again. This story of love, family, friendship, redemption, and forgiveness is definitely worth a try.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

It not really all historical but it a very intriguing part of Goblin.  The Romance was really great in this, I have one flaw but can't really go into it because of spoilers  Acting/Cast: I'm not going to be doing the acting/cast the way i usually do a person in the cast but I'm going to do the chemistry.  Gong Yoo, and Lee Dong Wook, is the first two I want to discuss. They had the perfect bromance in this that made me really love it between the two were really what made the show for me. the other one is Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun had great chemistry, and they had great chemistry with their romance was really well done.  Honorable mention to the second lead chemistry.    Music: The song that stuck out to m the most in this drama was Stay With Me. It fit the show so well, and It lets me have somewhat I call, that it made me love the show more. the other songs were OK, but they did not stick much (which is saying much because music is what I rate hard in dramas).   Rewatch/Overall: Overall this is a 10 for me, I love this show so much that it  worth a watch. The re watch value is also a 10, I will rewatch this.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

The lonely and beautiful man who had to undergo sadness, happiness, sadness and happiness again. And  he brought along with him the viewers to this roller coaster of emotions.  It definitely deserved its hype. It's one of those few dramas that actually deserved the hype. It has SUBSTANCE (very important for me) and you can not not finish it or else your questions about the drama will just remain as questions. Most episodes left me at awe and a lot of scenes gave me goosebumps. The second half of the drama was exceptional and I'm glad because a lot of dramas lose its beauty as they reach the second half. Goblin didn't.  Most of all, I love the relationships in the drama specifically of the four main leads: the goblin and his bride, kim woo bin and sunny, goblin and the grim reaper, part timer and her boss, the missing soul and the grim reaper, the queen and his brother, the king and the sister of the traitor, the king and his warrior. And you should never just shrug off the side characters — they play significant roles to the dramas's story.   And do I even need to explain why I rated the music a 10? The whole universe would agree that Goblin's OSTs were beyond amazing. And it wasn't just their music that was pleasing, the cinematography itself was aesthetically satisfying.   I gave the rewatch value a 8.5 only because if I rewatch again, I'd only focus on the second half of the drama and the humor of the first half (except episode 1 and 2 those were amazing episodes).   Overall, Goblin was an amazing drama. Not only because I cried a bucket of tears, but because it showcased how rich human (and nonhuman lol) relationships can be. How a single person can change your once believed ""life full of punishments,"" how forgiveness can heal not only the person forgiven but also you yourself and that actually, the existence of death makes life even more meaningful.   I can't even express myself properly through words *sighs* thank you Goblin. You are a gem.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Jasmine","/profile/jazz638","Jan 21, 2017","4","9.5","Overall 9.5    Story 9.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.0      Goblin was an ambitious drama-a high production value drama with gorgeous cinematography-and TvN pulled it off well. Granted, the ~90 minute episodes were a bit hard to adjust to and the drama did linger on some moments. Nevertheless, I never thought the drama was overhyped.   The combination of the breathtaking way scenes were filmed, and the wealth of heart Goblin possessed was enough to pull me in. I don't usually talk about editing but I have to say that Goblin's editing and stylistic filming are one of my favorites out of all dramas. I love the historic backstory, sometimes even more than the present. The historic story was the anchor of the emotional resonance of the present timeline.   Goblin's world of fantasy was fun, woven well, and interesting. The rules aren't always the most clear but I can accept that. The core of the story lied in the actions and consequences of the Goblin, and the lives he touched. Of course, the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper is my favorite relationship by far. The dry insults they pass back and forth amongst themselves are the best because under the insults lies affection, as much as they hate to admit it.   The romance in Goblin wasn't the most important to me until the second half of the drama, when the stakes were raised higher and the emotions felt heavier. Admittedly, I didn't love the romance between the Kim Shin and Eun Tak in the beginning because their relationship seemed to be more of a lost soul to lost soul connection, and not a romantic one. It wasn't until later did I finally feel their subtle chemistry, then I fell head in for them in the second half. Disclaimer: I cried so much, so freaking much. Be prepared to cry in the latter half of the drama. (This is a good thing, I think!)  The romance between the Grim Reaper and Sunny is poignant and heart wrenching. Their history lent their romance more weight but their present romance is filled with charged, tense chemistry all on their own. I loved them together honestly! SO much chemistry.Everyone's performance was fantastic. I have no complaints.  The soundtrack is AMAZING. OST's of a drama are so important to me in creating a more emotional bond with the scene and Goblin's is just on point in every take. Every song is utilized so well in the dramas and just add so much depth to the scenes.   Now, the not so good:  As I mentioned in the beginning, the drama did tend to linger and prolong many moments, which made them feel long. There were also times, especially in the beginning, where I feel like the plot became a little repetitive. However, the drama definitely became better and faster as the episodes went by, maybe because I got used to the length of it, but the plot also got tighter and more emotionally thrilling.  The ending, to me, felt very bittersweet. I cried loads and I feel somewhat unsatisfied. It is very memorable though, so there's that.  I definitely recommend Goblin to everyone, if anything, at least to try to see if it fits their taste. Disregarding the complaints about this drama, especially about the age gap controversy, I still think Goblin is a drama for everyone to at least try because Goblin is so much more than just the romantic relationships.

"Cookie","/profile/Cookkie","Jan 22, 2017","4","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 9.5 Rewatch Value 10      I'm writing this review because Goblin is my absolute favorite! I saw the last episode just now (I was postponing the episode 'cause I didn't want it to end but I couldn't take it any longer). The ending wasn't what I expected but it was nothing less than amazing.  The photography of this drama is the best I've seen in my whole life. Either in other KDramas, Chinese dramas, American dramas, American movies, French movies... Each frame of this drama is beautifully captured. My congratulation to the team behind this drama. They did a wonderful and beautiful job!    Story (10): Just to start... Gong Yoo. His my oppa! I really love him and his acting skills are amazing. However, his last dramas weren't my favorite, not because of his acting, but 'cause I thought they were too previsible. But this one, guys... I never got bored!  The plot is phenomenal and each character has his own part of the story.  The story's about a goblin and his bride, a girl who sees ghosts; a grim reaper and a very strong woman and their journey to be together. Their past mixes with their future. The romance is cute and funny, not lame. It has it all: romance, mystery, fantasy and a lot of bromance and funny moments!  Acting/Cast (10): Gong Yoo... The words speak for themselves. He's the main character, plays the goblin. His bride is Kim Go Eun, also amazing but, between the main characters, the one I disliked more. Even so, 9/10! The Grim Reaper is my favorite character and is played by Lee Dong Wook. I didn't know him but I fell in love right from the 1st episode. He did an amazing job. Yoo In Na plays Sunny, that strong women, who the Grim Reaper falls for. The Grim Reaper and Sunny are my OTP! They have an incredible chemistry on set.  I won't be talking about the other members of the cast or else I won't finish this review today!  Music (9.5): I'm completely hooked on ""Beautiful"" from Crush. Also, on ""You're so beautiful"", from Eddy Kim; ""Stay with me"", from Punch feat Chanyeol; ""I miss you"", from Soyou, etc, etc.... I gave it 9.5 'cause it's not the best OST that I have ever listened to, however, it's completely made for the drama and addictive. And that's what matters!  Rewatch Value (10): I never rewatch a drama! The only thing that I do repeat is films. I sometimes also repeat my favorite scenes from the dramas I've seen. However, I never rewatch the whole drama.  Should I correct myself? I've never rewatched a whole drama but I'll definitely rewatch this one. Not now, I'm too sad that it has ended however in the near future I'll rewatch it and watch it with new eyes and fall in love with it all over again...  PS: There's a kiss between the Grim Reaper and Sunny that's very similar to a ""statue kiss"" (for some reason this type of kiss is a must in every KDrama). It's not a really ""statue kiss"" (thank the gods!) but it's similar. I just expected a little more at that point as they share great chemistry. But, cheer up! That was the only bad thing in this drama! 11/10!!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Thevilone","/profile/Thevilone","Jan 30, 2017","4","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Goblin was the first K-drama I ever watched. And I think it is the best drama so far, hands down. If you haven't watched it, you probably should...like now! For you question why you should watch it? Here are my reasons :  If we talk about casting- though I'm new to this, I do Google a lot- I don't think their couldn't be any better then this.  Gong Yoo did an amazing job. I watched his movie 'Train to Busan' and one could say it hands down that he is an amazing actor, who knows how to do his job. And God his smile....Killer!!! I loved the 19 year old, over enthusiastic Ji Eun Tak who was portrayed by Kim Go Eun. The way we get to see how her character grew throughout the series was a treat.  I love Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper. I probably have a crush on the character and the way Lee Dong Wook showed his emotions in it, was amazing. I totally get it why he wanted this character so much.  Sunny was my favorite. She was strong and I'm probably never going to see a chicken shop owner the same way.  Yoo In Na, changed that for all of us.  Duk-Hwa played by Yook Sung Jae was so cute and such an 'rich heir'   The story line was perfect in it's own. The fact that it was a fantasy drama, it lives up the name with romance, comedy and mystery.  'The lady in red', 'The king', 'How Duk-Hwa knew stuffs' there are questions that will make sure you stick by the TV screen.   And then there is the 'Bromance'  The fling between Goblin & Grim Reaper will make you love them so hard. They are funny and cheesy and you are going to love every second of it. The scene where they walk together from the tunnel and the music going on the background, I laughed so hard.  Goblin and his bride - Eun Tak is second in the cute couple. They're cuteness will make you cheeks hurt.  The story between Sunny and Grim Reaper is a little sad compared to the other. But the beginning was full of fluff and sweet stuffs.   Each and every song in this drama is perfect with the story. They will stuck in your head for days and you will be forced to play them over and over again. I'm doing this my self - while re-watching the show for the second time. Especially loved 'Winter is coming' it is just a wonderful piece to listen too.  In short.. The songs were perfect. The cast was perfect. The story was incredible. And everything about it ...will make you fall in love with it.  So if you are one of those people out there, who haven't seen it yet, I would like to tell you....WATCH IT.

"Herman","/profile/HermanFassett","May 17, 2017","3","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 9.5 Rewatch Value 10    This review may contain spoilers   I think this drama just stole the first place in my favorites list! I laughed, I cried, it moved me Bob! Go watch this amazing drama now! Stop reading! Honestly, this is the highest quality drama I have ever seen. Not just the best, but the cinematography, the sets, the costumes, yes EVEN the Visual Effects were magnificently amazing. I didn't have to cringe my way through a scene that looked fake! No, instead I would be thinking ""Wow, what amazing camerawork, what an ingenious way to show that, look at that scenery!..."" etc, etc, etc. Story (10.0): I have yet to give a 10 across the board, and rating the story a 10 is almost as rare. This story is literally gobsmackingly amazing! If you need some context, it reminded me of a mix of some of my other favorite dramas: Healer just for the vibe of secrets and connections to be found; Queen In Hyun's Man for the previous lifetime, man from another time sort of story with an impossible love; Legend of the Blue Sea with similar feels of previous lifetimes and fated character connections, touches of supernatural. But honestly, it was also completely its own thing. It reminded me of elements from those other dramas, but took those and transcended them! Goblin was the perfect mix of romance and bromance, comedy and tragedy, love and heartbreak, life and death... This drama had way more than I asked of it and didn't ever once go off the rails. I won't spoil the ending or anything, but at the end of the drama I had SO MUCH FEELS I felt like I'd just watched a 50 episode Saeguk instead of a measly 16 episode package of awesomeness! I've heard some complaints about the lead female roles characters, but honestly what really made me love this story and made it stick out from all the other dramas I've seen was the characters and the interaction between the characters, the ways they try to express their feelings and learn from those around them, the witty banter and dialogue! I can't say how many times I laughed in this drama! I think episode 10 was my favorite just from this one hilarious bromance scene... AHHH! I want to write more about this story because it was pure GENIUS, but I can't say much more without giving some spoilers. Read the plot if you--never mind just go watch this. Acting/Cast (10.0): Perfection. I can't say I've finished anything Gong Yoo has been in and I honestly couldn't deal with Cheese in the Trap; nor have I watched much with Lee Dong Wook... BUT THEY WERE AMAZING. All those main three... I seriously can't deal with it. The story and dialogue was my favorite part between these three and they delivered the heck out of this. The bromance between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook was just the best. And I'm not forgetting the just as brilliant performances of Yoo In Na and Yook Sung Jae, on the contrary, I've seen these two in other dramas, most notably Queen In Hyun's Man and School 2015, and I loved them both there! How could I not like them here! I was always so sad to see Yoo In Na in the ""evil"" roles like in Secret Garden and You Who Came From the Stars, so it's a pleasure again to be rooting for her. I mentioned I couldn't get through Cheese in the Trap, but it was nothing to do with Kim Go Eun. Seriously, she was perfect for this role and acted it out splendidly. At first I was wary of the romance between her and Gong Yoo, and while they aren't my favorite couple out there, they really did a great job together! It was just great. As far as secondary actors go, I don't remember one bad actor... If I remember right, there may have been some of that classic KDrama cheesy English, but no biggie for everything else we get out of this show! Oh, props for Kim So Hyun! One of my favorite Actresses, I was so overjoyed to see her in this and she looks great in a historical setting! I'm so enjoying seeing her in Ruler: Master of the Mask after her role here in Goblin. Music (9.5): I really wanted to give this 10 all the way across the board and honestly this soundtrack is really good! I even listen to it on its own which I don't do unless I really enjoy a soundtrack. But it wasn't perfect for me as some of the songs didn't really fit with me. But I still gave it the highest possible rating I could without hitting that ten mark! Rewatch Value (10.0): Yes, a 10. Usually my rewatch values match pretty closely to the story value, and this is no exception. The story is just amazing especially the first time through when you don't know what's going to happen, but the interactions of the characters is just such a joy to watch that I've already started rewatching this! To be honest with you all, I watched the first half of this drama when it was first coming out; I loved it, but stuff happened and I never actually finished the drama... gasp! So when I was coming back to it, I was like whatever let's watch the first part again, and my rewatching hasn't stopped from there. This drama... I don't think I'll ever stop rewatching it. And I rarely rewatch anything, so yeah, it's good. Go watch it so you can rewatch it. Overall (10.0): How could I not give this drama a ten? The story was astounding, the acting was incredible, the music was amazing, everything was practically perfect in every way! I feel like I've said everything up above but that I still have so much more to say! I'm having trouble expressing how much I enjoyed this without posting spoilers... I'll probably be coming back to post new stuff in this review because I know I have more to say about this but it's all fled my mind to be replaced with the desire to go watch this again. Annyeong!!! Salanghae!!! P.S. Not my longest review, only coming in at a little over 1.1k words, but it's still a great effort. Hope this convinced you to go watch this drama.

How many times have you watched a drama and it's only when you finish the 3rd or 4th episode that it's starting to get good ? In Goblin in episode 1 you are introduced to all main characters without an ""in your face"" introduction. The world building is enough for understanding the story, but keeps just enough mystery and details to catch the attention. The music is amazing and, from I remember, well timed between scenes. In some dramas you feel like by episode 2 you heard them all already, in this one it takes more and the ambience is fitting (plus I think they are very good, even though it's not really my type). The casting is phenomenal and every character have a story that is relevent and interesting. The second roles are not just a distraction from the main cast's story. I could talk about Goblin all day, but finally, The plot and ending, you dont see it comming and it's more and more rare these days I think, that's all I'm gonna say.I'm a grown man in my twenties and I cried many times and that's what I want from dramas, to reach my emotions. whether it was from sadness, hapinnes or both is for you to find out.

"Pincolino","/profile/M.Simon","Apr 17, 2018","3","8.5","Overall 8.5    Story 7.0 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.0      When a series has such a high rating, there is only one explantion for it: It appeals to a majority of people. And what appeals to a majority of people? Something that's simple. Well, honestly, Goblin is really beautiful. If you want to watch something nice, calming and beautiful - watch Goblin. I cannot imagine that there are people out there who don't like it or don't enjoy it. The cinematography, the music, the scenery - spectacular. The best I have ever seen in any Korean drama to date. So why the rather low rating? It has no substance. The story isn't very exciting. After four episodes I felt like I knew everything I had to know about the main couple. What keeps you watching then? The love story of the Grim Reaper, I guess. Unfortunately he and Sunny only had a few scenes in every episode while the main couple is going back and forth. Again and again. There were so many recaps later on (I don't know when it started to annoy me), many flashbacks, I felt like they recycled scenes. The end product was somehow very artistic (I will admit that), but the story in general wasn't very deep. The emotions couldn't reach me. If I compare Goblin to the drama Korean Odyssee I recently watched I must say that the latter made me cry and weep like a baby many times while I had a hard time feeling sad for the Grim Reaper or the Goblin. I cried when the old men climbed the stairs to heaven and his dog was there waiting for him - just saying. That was sad. Maybe it was because of the comedy between the two characters (there was comedy between the couples too), but even though they had a tragic past, they lived pretty good lives for a very long time. I mean even if they would have died at the end of the series (for real) they had a satisfying life. This series was in general very ""satisfying"". Every single moment felt satisfying. I just think there was no real reason for being sad. I felt like they shared too many tears that couldn't reach me. So to make it short: Story: 4/10 (not much depth), but the execution was 10/10, so I wil give it a solid 7Acting: 9 (because I think Lee Dong Wook could have done a better job, I liked him a lot more in ""Scent of a Woman"")Music: 10 (it cannot get any better)Rewatch value: Well, if I want to relax and enjoy something that's beautiful for the sake of being beautiful ... 8.

Every character had it's own habits and weirdness but that made them even more loveable.At first I had my trouble with the female lead Kim Go Eun because sometimes it seems as if she's trying to hard and it made me cringe but maybe that's because we meet her in different stages of her life, as a highschool senior and a college student and at her later work. So it is kind of understandable that she goes through some changes in life and in her personality and that made me really like her later on.The relationship between the Goblin and his Bride developed with some ups and downs and even more interesting was the relationship between the Grim Reaper and Sunny - SO HEARTBREAKING! I loved the fact that the Grim Reaper probably went through the biggest and hardest change during the series as he starts off as an emotionless weirdo.I loved the music! I even added it on my playlist and I'm listening to the intro song all the time!I would rewatch it but this drama made me so emotional!! I think that I was crying all the time through the last 3 episodes...that's almost like 5 hours of crying.It had kind of an ending I could be happy with but before I could be happy it had to punch me in the face and heart and everything came so suddenly...so I will wait until I have the nerves to watch it again.Overall - I LOVED IT!

If you haven't watched it yet you should! The acting was absolutely amazing. All of the characters had chemistry and you could tell they enjoyed what they were doing. The bromance between the Goblin and the Reaper even became famous, but this time it actually seems like the actors truly became friends. The story was great, it pulled at your heartstrings. I laughed, and cried, and was scared (there are some spooky parts and I was watching this alone in the dark at night, so don't judge me -_-). The ending was sad, yet wonderful. The especial effects are actually really good. The music is great. All in all a well made drama, and I highly recommend it.    Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Imara","/profile/imaramarino","Jan 13, 2018","3","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Goblin was the first k-drama I saw. Until that moment I had just only watched Japanese dramas, but at the time I already knew Gong Yoo for ""Train a Busan"" and I had heard so much about the show that I gave it a try.After this, I watched lots of k-dramas, so I guess this show is to blame that now I'm a k-drama addict. And even having watching so many of them, anything could be compared to Goblin. Without any doubt it's the best drama I've ever seen in my entire life.Everything is wonderful. The story (from a non-used to k-dramas point of view) is kind of unusual. The photography, the settings (oh, Quebec, one of the most wonderful places I've ever been), the dialogues, the humor, the bromance, the romance...I love Gong Yoo in every one of the things he has done, but here he is amazing as the lonely tokebi. For the rest of the casting, they are all perfect, overall Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper (his bromance with the Goblin is mythic, so funny!)Other thing that I really liked in this show is that you don't have a love triangle, nor the tropes so used in other dramas, and you have the opportunity to see the evolution in both couples.The only thing I complain is that the main couple does not have much explanation time at the ending  as they should have. There were too much time to explain the Grim Reapers and Sunny (not Sun Hee) future and not so much for the main couple... Dommage!This show taugh me so many things I could continue for hours explaining why everybody should watch it.I have read some bad reviews explaining that it's so slow that is boring. I don't know but for me it wasn't slow at all. It had the right pace for a perfect development of the story and the characters.Music: loved it. One of by k-drama OST.Rewatch value: I've watched this show three times already and I watch it every now and then while I deciding what to see next.So, last advise, DON'T MISS IT, BEST DRAMA EVER!

"Sarah","/profile/Binkles","Apr 25, 2018","3","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      This drama hit me like a truck, I heard it was good but I was really not prepared. Note to anyone who is even vaguely emotional: You will need tissues, you will probably cry. A lot. And hopefully laugh a lot too! The actors chemistry for this drama was perfection, they gelled so well and the stories intertwining with one another was amazingly well written. I wasn't as keen on  the Grim Reaper at the start but I warmed to him as the drama continued and he became a firm favourite, although in fairness, I loved them all, apart from that Aunt and her kids, they can go away! Although a lot of it is serious and deals with a lot of difficult subjects/themes, there's a lot of hilarious moments too and you get to witness budding friendships between an unlikely group of characters which also results in some very funny sections of the drama. The story is full of twists and turns which leave you at the edge of your seat, I for one am SO glad that I didn't watch this whilst it was airing where I'd have to endure waiting for the next episode week to week, it would have been torture! I've only watched 23 dramas, giving 2 including Goblin a 10 (the other being ""It's ok, that's love"" because of the difficult topics it deals with incredibly well) but honestly, I'd give Goblin a 100+ if I could, I've never laughed and cried so much for one drama. You will feel happiness, sadness, elation, loneliness, grief and heartache at various stages of this but it's worth  it thousands of times over. I'd rewatch this over and over again when I need a good dose of feels or just a laugh at a certain secretarie's dance moves and super serious bromance moments. The OST is beautiful and I have got it all saved on my Spotify for when I need a Goblin moment! It captures the mood of the drama so well, it's worth a listen away from the drama to fully appreciate it. I've seen people complaining about the age gap which I can kinda understand but at the same time, in this day an age there being an age gap in a relationship isn't uncommon, she's 19/20 in this, I don't see it as being particularly 'creepy' as her character is immensely mature and has a lot of depth. Love isn't confined to age. There has also been criticism of product placement but it doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as the obvious sticky tape over brand labels that I see in man other dramas. I'm so used to product placement in TV shows and movies that it doesn't really bother me, some of the placements were quite funny anyway. If anything, Goblin has done a great job at making me want to go back to visit Canada again ;3 I held off from watching this for ages as the plot sounded a bit weird but I regret not watching it sooner as I would have been able to re-watch it a few times by now so if you are hesitating, please just go and watch it and you will understand what all the fuss is about.

I tell all people that goblin is a work of art, it is almost impossible to stop watching after you start.the actors are captivating, you learn to love them more and more throughout the episodes and then you feel miss them when you finish watching all the episodes. the friendship between the goblin and the reaper is really something from another world, I love it when characters create sympathy throughout the episodes and create a bond of strong friendship. in general, the relationships in this drama are well thought out and everything was thought out very well.the scenarios and soundtrack of the drama really are good, I listen to the soundtrack every day, I feel so happy listening to these songs.

The latter statement  is more bold, but this drama holds to your expectations and will fly past them.I've rewatched this drama a countless number of times without finding substantial flaws, even if I'm being nitpicky. You'll love these characters and their relationships (be it romance, bromance, or friendship) long past your first time watching it, and you'll remember their most iconic quotes, too.Goblin is a masterpiece with gorgeous cinematography, writing, and one of the best OSTs I've ever heard. Not only that, but it's completely different from any other drama out there while being down to earth and heartwarming as well.The only reason I would not recommend this drama is if you have never watched a KDrama before- Goblin is so perfect that once you've seen it, most any other drama will be lackluster thereafter.

First off the soundtrack in this drama was so amazing and really awesome, I loved the main song. Goblin has just made my favorites list,  the cinematography was gorgeous, the music was amazing, the actors were perfect, The story will make you laugh and make you cry. Not only is the love story epic, but so is the bromance between Goblin and Reaper. I've found that I'm quite fond of this fantasy genre and this has been done so well. I have hardly any criticisms of this show at all because even the flaws faded into nothing noticeable for me. It's sweet, funny, romantic, sad, tragic, beautiful...Goblin is a great drama. I went into it with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised, or more accurately, I was blown away. You can recognize a good drama by the way it makes you feel exactly what the characters in the drama are feeling. That's the way Goblin was for me, with each character, I laughed and I cried.The actors do a superb job. I could feel their emotions from across the screen. then again, nothing less to be expected from such a spectacular cast.-The drama has everything, ranging from bromance, romance to mystery and suspense.-The bromance is spectacular. One of the most epic bromance I've ever seen in a Kdrama. It made me laugh a lot, but it also had its heartwarming and heart-wrenching moments. Goblin and Grim Reaper's relationship is one of the best reasons to pick this up. The two couples- Goblin & Eun Tak and Grim Reaper & Sunny. Both couples had their own story. The sweet and cute moments of the Goblin couple & the sizzling chemistry between Grim Reaper and Sunny was enough to keep the 'romance' meter of the drama pretty high. You won't be able to get enough of the cuteness of Goblin & Eun Tak.-The mystery of the characters. From 'the lady in red' to the king and queen, each episode just gave enough glimpse into their lives to keep us engrossed. It'll drive you crazy in a good way.-Each minute of every episode was enjoyable. I didn't skip a single moment of any episode.-The unexpectedness of the drama was really great. Just when you'd think you had something figured out, some twist would come along and surprise you. The writer sure did a tremendous job.BONUS: Beautiful and addictive OSTI LOVED this drama! Do give this one a chance, you won't be disappointed. Once you start it, chances are, you'll end up loving it. Happy Watching!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

If this drama worth for something it's for its surrealism.The plot was weak, the characters inconsistent, the FL had a completely childish behavior, the Goblin's character is weak and immature and the end was horrible as the Goblin didn't manage to get what he wished for.The clever trick of this drama is that we watch the story from the Goblin's point of view though the actual protagonist and the character that leads the plot is the Reaper.Anyway...The plot is inconsistent and boring but interaction between the actors who were improvising and had fun while they were filming ( probably due to the lack of a solid script!! lol ) along with the cinematography and the music make an unbeatable combination.It is the kind of series that you would expect to see if Pedro Almodovar , Guillermo Del Toro and Tim Burton joined their powers to make a festive ( Christmas or similar ) series.9,5 out of 10 from me for the surrealism and fun factor.

Only towards the end did I begin to truly feel the impact that the two had made on each other, but maybe that is because all the actors started to cry in, like, every scene lol. The arc with Park Woo Joon was really scary, because I quite literally can't stand any thriller, horror, or any deceased makeup lmao and turned the humorous-lightheartedness of the drama immediately into something darker. There was much more action in the last 4-5 episodes than the long buildup in the first 12 episodes, but you eventually understand what all those little moments meant in the end, which I guess is sort of rewarding. In the end, my thoughts were sort of jumbled because the world didn't seem to have order. Many things happened that just didn't make sense according to information given or revealed beforehand. The last episode, especially, was really unbelievable because of what Goblin said about having the same face.Ultimately, I thought the acting, humor, and touching aspects of Goblin were well done (also every person in this drama --except Park Woo Joon ew-- was very beautiful) but the development and execution of the story was not very well done. I watched this show because 1) my friend recommended it as it was his first kdrama, 2) it received critical claim after its release, and 3) GONG YOO, and I'm glad I did for those reasons. There are some scenes that are very, very quick, but for some reason it pulled on my heart and began to cry. Those moments, though, were never central to the main plot line and that may have been the problem. Basically, this drama wasn't fantastic per say and keep that in mind if you decide to watch.**One last thing: the soundtrack was alright, but not impressive to other OST music I've heard. My favorite was ""I miss you"" but the others didn't really draw any emotion from me? Perhaps that is because my favorite drama right now is Scarlet Heart Ryeo and I fell in love so hard with both the drama and the music that I came into Goblin with the bar raised too high.

Well, you found it! In my opinion scores 10/10 are totally inadequate because the series, although it is really good, does not deserve more than 7. The story is interesting and departs from typical dramas where love and an attempt to save the other person at all costs preside over them. Unfortunately, the execution did not go as well as the producers would like.  Why? THE FEMALE LEAD.  When it comes to the males - they ware amazing. The chemistry between them was flawless and this part I will never deny nor forget. but Ji Eun Tak played by Kim Go Eun was driving me nuts. Her character was annoying and I don't understand how Goblin would fell in love with her. She was a traumatised child who decided to something fun as help a goblin die.

The show centers around the growing and tragic relationship between a high school student and a 900 something year old warrior turned Goblin (Korean Goblin). The execution down the line is flawed like they were writing the plot while they were filming.Did they really have to make Ji Eun-tak (Kim Go-eun) a high school student? No, but I guess they wanted to get that demographic.  She is fated to be the ""Goblin's Wife"". The relationship eventually turns romantic. The show glosses over the extreme age difference between the two and the Goblin (Gong Yoo) certainly doesn't look or act (most of the time) like 900. I found Ji Eun-tak to be very charming and the weakness to her character could be attributed to the forced writing. The romance between the two was very forced but when the tragedy hits, the two main actors are very good at conveying sadness. Gong Yoo is good comedic actor and the Goblin get's riled up comedically due to the new people he meets after his long life.Another large plot element involves the Grim Reapers. The main Grim Reaper (Lee Dong-wook)  is put into close contact through fate with the goblin and the high schooler. He starts off as a cold and stoic character. There are scenes interspersed throughout the series of GR sending off lost souls to their next destination. I found most of these scenes to be touching. Also, most of the funniest scenes involve him and the Goblin. Past lives and reincarnation play a big part in the story.  We slowly see the tragic past of the Goblin and what events led him to live a long unaging life. The Grim Reapers were once humans who have committed horrible sins while they lived and they work in death with their memories wiped of their past lives. Main GR's past life seems to be connected with the Goblin's life before the Goblin was cursed/blessed with immortality. Unfortunately, we have the cliched Kdrama push and pull, and initial denial of feelings that plague even the best romantic dramas.  I never really got why the two mains would fall in love, but once the plot moves past that point, the mains have good chemistry together.  Tragedy comes at the hand of God (literally). It's not really explained well why the god wants these characters to not come together or die or whatever. The finale is a mess but it relies on the audience to follow it based on tragic emotions. All in all it was a fun time but thinking back on it makes the flaws glare out.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Either the Goblin needed to be much younger or Eun Tak needed to be much older. The Goblin was a 39 year old man before his transformation, the FL Eun Tak is a 19 year old HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT whose parents died when she was young. She was living with neglectful, abusive family members, she comes off as vulnerable and naïve. She is in no way mature in looks or acts. It is hard to buy that a 939 worldly Goblin/man is going to fall in love with a girl who acts like an entitled toddler. The fact that he does is creepy. I have zero issues with age gaps in general, but the age gap is glaring since Eun Tak is written to be so immature and spends most of her time dressed in a school uniform. The whole time I watched there was no chemistry between the two, which I am glad for but also it is supposed to be a romantic fantasy drama, at least cast it so we don't feel skeeved out every time the leads are on screen together. What I saw of the Reaper and Sunny was great.  Deok Wha was enjoyable and should have more of a story line. The bromance is great and should have been more developed.

I started watching for the fantasy aspect but considering how hyper-focused this story is on the couple(whose chemistry feels super forced!) I could not continue watching it. I like both of these actors on their own. My biggest problem is that the male lead is very old(cannonically) and idk what's wrong with the stylists but with some of his clothing he looks straight up in his late forties. The female lead, on the other hand, is in high school!!! She walks around in pivotal scenes in HER HIGH SCHOOL UNIFORM. I don't care if she is older than 18.  It feels very gross and these two have terrible chemistry together. The actress also looks very young. In general, their visuals do not go together in the slightest. 2nd problem: The plot is SLOPPY. There is so much ""back and forth"" and with the horrible pacing it's just a absolute pain to get through.  The amount of times the plot was like ""she can see the sword??"" ""no, she can't."" ""yes she can!"" like omg it drags on so much. The female lead is supposedly the main character but any moral dilemmas she goes through with having this old ass man wanting her to be his bride, it hardly shows! Instead, the story telling relies on the male characters TELLING you this female lead is going through a hard time. garbage show.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Admittedly, those two names were the initial reasons why I got curious about this drama. Later on, it was my 30-second glimpse of episode five when the male leads were going to the apps store (really cracked me up) that sealed the deal. Because of that, I was under the impression that this will be just another light rom-com drama with a touch of fantasy. Boy was I wrong.  I didn't watch any trailer before I started this drama and I wasn't prepared for the emotional roller coaster that it put me in. A salad of fantasy, romance, drama, and comedy, Goblin was able to make me laugh, smile, and cry all in one episode. There was no boring episode although I must admit that the last three dragged on a bit.  Though sometimes a bit forced and repetitive, the romance in this drama was good. The actors definitely knew what they were doing in that area. Now the bromance, a favorite of most Goblin fans, was just AMAZING. (All caps, people!). Having Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook acting adorably awkward and goofy in the same screen is now my second favorite thing next to chocolate fudge cake. More importantly, this drama is more than just about love that transcends time and death or about ""destiny outside of man's boundary."" Beyond the witty exchanges and the most poetic lines I've heard - or read (hurrah, subtitles!) in a drama, Goblin tackles deeper themes about  friendship, life choices, and regrets.   Not to mislead you though, this drama is not perfect. There are a lot of underlying storylines that are undeveloped and could have made the story more awesome than it already was. By the time you realized it though, you've fallen in love with the drama and its characters that you won't have a choice but to overlook and forgive these plot holes.   The best part that I like about this drama (except for Goblin's and the Grim Reaper's bromance) is the music. Simply put - PERFECT. I don't understand Korean but the melody and how the songs were laid in each scene was so effective I would rate it 11 if possible. There were also some important scenes when I expected a background music but instead I was given raw acting and raw dialogue making the scenes more effective.  Last but definitely not the least, I was in awe of the cinematography of this drama. If not for Gong Yoo's face in the first episode, I wouldn't have been sure if I was watching a k-drama or some Hollywood/Chinese fantasy movie. They definitely spared no expense in making this drama. Then again, they probably also earned tons from all the advertisement they had.   All in all, Goblin is a strange and beautiful drama that is definitely one of the best k-dramas I've seen.

The opening theme to the first ost Stay with me already tells you the music for this drama is equally daebak  I would never have imagined Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook in the same drama. But there must be drama gods hearing the people's prayers and hopes. The bromance of Goblin and Grim is so spot on, friendship, laughters and more. The main cast all pull their weight from Kim Go Eun whose natural beauty and calibre was suited as bright Eun Tak to Yook Sung Jae and Yoo In Na. Even its supporting cast (Samshin, Director yoo, Secretary kim,  Park Joong Won) were all superb and each had commanding screenpresence and brought so much to the narration of the story.  Towards the end i love the message that humans though seemingly small and frail compared to deities and the almighty, but we can surprise you with our will that can change the course of fate. And lastly to live and love like its your last day. Its so simple but often forgotten. I'll cherish this drama. And for now there isnt a drama i can recommend that quite captures the gist, the tone, and the feels like Goblin does. Thats how unique it is.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"ale","/profile/Sadrietty","Jan 25, 2017","3","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 8.0 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 9.0 Rewatch Value 8.0      Due to the immense hype this drama received I was interested like everyone else to see what's behind the drama that got everyone speechless.  At the beginning I remember being quite judging towards the duration of the episodes because you can easily turn episodes with an average of 1h and 15min into a sleeping feast. To my surprise the episodes passed really quickly though - which means they structured them in a way which left me constantly entertained and/or emotionally tense. The plot by itself wasn't that complicated but the flashbacks to the Goryeo era and the foreshadowing made it more fancier. Plotholes definitely exist in this drama - especially at the end and I didn't really like their conclusion since it felt rushed.   What we all need to praise though is the amazing cinematography - it is unlike any other drama I've ever watched. First of all, at the beginning I was so stunned by everything that was presented to me that I honestly thought ""how much effort did they put into this it is like a high quality movie"". The special effects  weren't ridiculous at all and everything harmonized so wonderfully. It keeps its well thought out quality until the end -  it is seriously a nice experience. Dramas in the future will have to step up when they want to surpass this drama quality-wise.  The second best thing about this whole drama is the cast. The jokes are fresh and immensely cute at the same time. Be ready to laugh every episode. I think this drama achieved to be deeply emotional but hilarious at the same time without losing its seriousness? I am also happy that they integrated two male protagonists that harmonize the best out of all the cast members -  and also built a happy trio with Sungjae's character. In addition we really need to take a moment to honor Gongyoo's acting - so incredibly good.  All in all, I would definitelly recommend watching this one since it is one of the best dramas I've ever watched. It manages to pull out fresh jokes left and right without having an overused plot. It is indeed worth the hype.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I found Goblin incredibly slow for the first twelve-ish episodes and boring in regards to the first six or seven, but the last four episodes were so great that my initial rating transformed highly, and I'm so glad I was patient with this, instead of dropping it. However, Goblin still has things I didn't like.  Like I said, the pacing is the by far the biggest problem, but there were a couple of obvious plot holes I didn't like, plus the character of the FL until she becomes more mature was very irritating at parts. But these are no problem in the last four episodes. In fact, the last four episodes showcased the potential of the story, characters and acting abilities into action. I think the main thing I liked about Goblin was the star-studded cast and their brilliant performances as always, and the other cast members I hadn't seen before or wasn't too much of a fan of, well, guess what, Goblin changed my opinion on them too, in a more positive fashion. Another brilliant thing I must mention is the delightful OST (although in my eyes, a little bit overplayed). All in all, it is a very, very slow start, but the wait is worth it. Can I recommend it though for others? Only for people who can never drop a drama!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

This might be probably one of my favorites genres, but the fated trope didn't disappoint me.I loved the speed it was going, the way emotions were portrayed, honestly a masterpiece.I must say I'm sad we didn't get more of some side characters, but the two romances the story gives out are so well put, they made me cry more than once.And honestly I didn't expect the happy ending, but I was so relieved. This will probably end up taking a sweet spot in my heart cause it just got me so emotional.The cast is amazing, they made me fall for each one of them. Gong Yoo, Kim Go-eun, Lee Dong-wook and Yoo In-na made such a spectacular performance, their tears were my tears. The ost was great, also there's not once I skipped the opening or the credit song cause they were SO good. I'll probably rewatch it often cause it was just way too good to be forgotten.

"Maliya","/profile/MelinaFiori","Jul 12, 2022","1","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 9.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 8.5 Rewatch Value 9.0    A charming modern fairy tale with a fresh love story  I refused to watch Goblin for a long time, kept skipping it until it finally ended up on my ""Not Interested"" list. A few days ago I came across an article about it, the topic was Korean fantasies on Netflix, and this time it piqued my curiosity and I decided to give it a chance. I didn't regret it. What did I like so much about this ""Goblin""? It wasn't the main character by any means, though he was a nice guy. It wasn't the chemistry between the couples, which was teased in the story of a larger-than-life fate that brings two couples together over several lifetimes, because I didn't feel that chemistry. I'm a fan of the fantasy genre, but I wouldn't prioritize this series as fantasy because I missed it driving the main thread of the story. And the love story was kind of weird - no strong passion or heartwarming scenes. Finally..... Without hesitation, I rated ""Goblin"" a 9/10. I wonder, I really wonder, how this series won me over. Now, as I write it, it may crystallize for me. First of all, the two main female characters were just adorable - sweet, pure, sparkling, gentle, with a fragile feminine air, though not fragile characters. The ""goblin bride"" was such a fresh image - a woman-child oozing energy that floods you with good feeling. Actress Kim Go Eun (the second season of ""Yumi's Cells"" is currently running with her) is super cute. The other lead actress whose performance I liked is Yoo In Na, who later starred with the same partner in ""Touch My Heart"".The men, aside from the sole villain, were gentlemen with a history of tragic bad guys - a king and a general who endure punishment while living the lives of a goblin and an angel of death. However, the viewer sees nothing wrong with them. They are so considerate, caring, sensitive, sacrificial - every woman's dream men. There was also a cute minor character - a young boy, a third generation heir, who added spice to the story without his character actually undergoing development. Aside from the king's uncle and the main character's aunt, the typical spiteful, ugly, morally repugnant lost Korean souls that are so stifling in any series were absent. Two cursed enemies become good friends, outgrowing loathing and revenge. There is no shortage of humor in the crisp dialogue between all the actors.  All in all, this is a drama of pure relationships and genuine people - like a brochure of life as we would like to live it, labeled ""Feel good story"". There's no intrigue, no attempts at someone wanting to take someone else's man/woman away, no parents opposing the relationship - well, there's no intrigue overall, but I didn't miss it. And the ending was nice - I won't spoil if anyone hasn't watched it. Overall, I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it and likes romantic fantasies to give it a try. It leaves a nice feeling in the heart and is watchable in one breath. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Obviously, a review a few years than useful to anybody, but here it is!I searched far and wide for the show since there are so many references to it in various reviews for other shows, and it seemed like a worthwhile effort. I ended up binge watching it (which I really try not to do) -- it sucked me in.But, to start with, the negatives:* The age gap thing. It was physically gross. As others have pointed out, the female lead acts very much like a teenager, a young and immature teenager, and the scenes in which the two leads are pushed together for romantic reasons were truly gross. Which is actually a credit to the acting, since in later part, when the female lead is supposedly 10 years older, the feeling disappeared. Still -- it really did make me feel gross to have the romantic scenes between a teenager and an adult.* I may be the only one, but I did not like the secondary romance -- it made next to no sense. The two actors were wonderful -- but the internal logic of their history was nonsensical.* The ending. There are a couple of components to my dissatisfaction with it, and they all involve lack of any actual resolution. For one -- the goblin ""dies"" or whatever it is he does, but then is called back -- and is still a goblin. Wasn't he supposed to die? Does this mean he never dies? And the whole thing repeats three more times?* The ""reveal"" of who the grim reaper is was telegraphed so early that it was not a reveal at all.The positives are what others have pointed out: Engaging story that, overall, holds together logically; good acting; excellent chemistry among all of the actors (not just the romantic leads) -- the wonderful bromance!; the beautiful music.So, in the end, I am glad that I got to watch it, despite the occasional grossness.

Still why I am feeling unsatisfied is everything is easily predictable and also the ML who is 900+ years old acts like 10 years old child (may be to match the FL who is sooo bubbly), or may be because the ML is social outcast kind, if so it is still unacceptable because he was the general of his army and he was matured on that time. I must appreciate the cameraman, cinematography, choreography, music and songs, so many times I was stunned thinking that which special effect camera they are used in this drama and once again the music and songs with that situation is really heart-felting one. And one more thing what I felt disappointed is when ML disappears she went for some blind dates and she develops feelings to someone(even though he his her loved one but she didn’t knew on that time) even though she was unclear about her previous love and also she knew that she was the bride of some one whom she love very much or may be I interpreted it in a different or a wrong way may be the director intend to show that the love is that kind of magic even though you don’t have memory (about him) but you will have the same feeling with that right person. In an over all I can only say this is good drama in all aspects but poorly executed.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I don't think it's romantic and I can't imagine why you would think that it's okay for a 900 year something to fall for a child, A CHILD. It's inappropriate and nothing sexually happend with a minor but still.... Personally it was a complete dealbreaker. (I wanna say I don't think the girls crush or her perspective is weard I completely blame the old dude)Again every character seems well thought out and portrait lovely, I love the side story's, but the main storyline is just weard and inappropriate.

Seeing the relationship grow between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper was the best part of the show for me - many funny moments and many touching ones as well.The acting was top notch and I was particularly touched by the overwhelming sadness conveyed by the Grim Reaper so I was glad he had a happy ending. His pale outlook fit his Grim Reaper look very well but I was happier to see him in his other character that had a moustache - so tormented but more handsome. The Goblin was a bit too quirky at times (drying his hair while acting like a teenager, singing a love song etc) which I found to be out of character. FL was spot on with her expressions and mannerisms which made for a believable high school student. Cinematography and story telling were well done, particularly how the Grim Reaper works.But...I was not comfortable seeing a romance between a student (19) and an older adult (39 for the last 900 years). Can’t be helped since the story relies on the age 9, 19, 29 explanation of when someone is the most vulnerable.Thankfully, there was the romance of the second couple to pull me back into the show whenever I got a bit unsettled seeing the FL in her school uniform cozying up to the ML.This drama’s theme song hit the right notes for me. It was haunting yet evoked a mystical aura which I feel really suited the show.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Goblin has just made my favorites list. Even my husband got sucked in and loves this show. The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was amazing, the actors were perfect (Hello, Gong Yoo!), the story was heartbreakingly beautiful.This is the first time I've watched any of the main actors except Yoo In Na. I have now officially developed a Gong Yoo crush and understand why drama fans are enamored of him. Gong Yoo as Kim Shin/ Goblin was mesmerizing. I could listen to his voice for days. Every scene he was in was a treat. Every emotion that his character had was palpable, and his smiles could light up the sky.And Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak was super cute. She had a lot of detractors and the writer got a lot of flak for making her so young. But the character and her age were perfect for this story and how it unfolded.Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper had the perfect deadpan (heh) delivery. And he may be the best male ""crier"" I've seen yet.The story will make you laugh and make you cry. Not only is the love story epic, but so is the bromance between Goblin and Reaper. I've found that I'm quite fond of this fantasy genre and this has been done so well. I have hardly any criticisms of this show at all because even the flaws faded into nothing noticeable for me. It's sweet, funny, romantic, sad, tragic, beautiful...The music was perfect and perfectly lovely. I don't always pay much attention to the music, but this show utilized it so well and chose the perfect songs. So many people loved even the intro song that they made a special recording of it to make it a full length song (Round and Round, but may also be found under Never Far Away). Beautiful by Crush was the best song in my opinion, and I believe that it was the theme song for our main couple. And Stay With Me by Chanyeol and Punch was another favorite.Rewatch value is high - if not everything, then there are many, many favorite scenes that I'll go back to and relive the feels. :)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I loved her bubbly personality and positive energy! Yes, she did act a bit childish as many people said, but I personally didn't mind it because I thought it suited her very well.In general, it's a very cute drama and one of the best ones I have seen. Although the last few episodes could have been better, in my opinion.[Downsides]:1) VERY slowI had to watch 90% of this drama at x1.5 speed due to its slow pace. Many scenes were also shot in slow motion.2) Fillers / Repetitive ScenesI had to skip over A LOT of flashback scenes of past memories. Honestly, they could have made this drama 8 episodes instead of 16.3) Age DifferenceThere was a huge age gap between the two leads. It looked as if he was in his 40s, dating a high school student. It was a bit weird, but I had to ignore it and focus on their adorable personalities to enjoy the drama.Despite all that, I'm glad I watched this drama and I still recommend people to watch it.Enjoy :)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"vampbunny","/profile/vampbunny","Oct 26, 2022","1","9.5","Overall 9.5    Story 9.5 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 9.0    This review may contain spoilers   This drama had been recommended to me quite a lot and I finally decided to give it a shot. A very cute and slow burn love story, while also having a really great found family story that goes on as well. The one downfall to such a great story - a not so great ending - so if you're looking for something that ends happy and leaves you feeling satisfied, this isn't the watch for you. While the overall story and characters make this drama so worth it, the end made it fall so flat for me and actually had me a bit disappointed and confused. I will add - a lot of people have a problem or find it problematic about the age gap in the relationship (900+ vs 19), but if you can look past this it's a great love story about fated and destined love.-- Spoilers Below --Kim Shin is a goblin that has been sentenced to live out an immortal life as punishment for the many sins he committed in his first lifetime. He has a ghostly blade stuck in his chest and the only way for him to be able to die and rest peacefully is to meet his destined, Goblin's Bride, and have her pull it out. From the outside, you can tell that Kim Shin is caring, loving and kind. He loves giving out tiny miracles and helping people out, but also harbors deep trauma and sadness from his life. He has outlived everyone that he once knew and will continue to do so. Eun Tak is a senior in high school who can see ghosts. From a young age, she has been able to see and talk to lingering ghosts, but avoids doing so after her mother dies. She runs into a grim reaper as well, but is able to make it away due to the kindness of a granny passing by. She lives her life out with ghosts pointing out and telling her that she's the Goblin's Bride. On her 19th birthday, she decides to finally make a wish after her life is in a rut. Dealing with her abusive aunt and family to being bullied in school, she needed something. After blowing out her candles, there appears Kim Shin behind her. It starts a whirlwind up and down relationship between the two, where she knows she's the Bride but Kim doesn't believe her. They slowly fall in love and begin to actually feel for one another. Wang Yeo, or known more as Mr. Reaper, is Kim Shin's friend that he lives with. He leads people on their death journey, helping them on their way before their next life. He himself knows that to become a Grim Reaper, you have to commit a great sin, but cannot remember his past life at all, not even his own name. He eventually runs into a woman on the street and feels as though he as seen her before and begins crying. This sensation doesn't only happen the one time, but again when he see's a painting that Kim Shin had been keeping of a woman. He falls in love with Sunny, a beautiful and witty business owner, and tries to be a normal human towards her. While at some point, she grabs him and he sees her entire lifetime, learning that she was involved in his and Kim Shin's, her being the latter's sister. They learn of his real past life, that he was the King that slaughtered many, and even was the cause of death of Sunny and Kim Shin.Every single happening in their lives happens because of an evil entity named Park Joong Hun. He caused the car crash that Kim Shin reversed to safe Eun Tak, and he causes every little happening of possible death to her after. They eventually figure out his true identity and in the climax of the show, Kim Shin pulls out the sword and banishes him. Not long after he himself is banished to a world of nothing but snow and cold. 10 years go by and Eun Tak has no recollection or memory of the Goblin, but can feel in her heart that she is mourning the loss of someone/something important to her. Her and Sunny help each other out, both dealing with their grief of losing a loved one. Eventually because of the contract they made before his passing, Eun Tak makes a wish and he comes back. It takes a while for her to regain her memory, and after that it begins a happily ever after. They get married and everything seems well... This is where I begin my small rant on the end of this show. After they get married, Mr. Reaper is waiting on a deadly car crash that is going to kill an entire bus of kindergarteners. Before this is slotted to happen, Eun Tak drives by and waves at him before continuing on. At this moment is when he realizes that she is about to die and get her death card and that HE was the reaper she was destined to see at age 29 just like he was at 9 and 19. She ends up sacrificing her life to save the kids, due to her destiny of having to die. A couple of years after her life ends, the Reaper's punishment is over and he can reincarnate in his next life. Before this he also leads Sunny to her afterlife and reincarnation. At the end, it's shown that all 3 (Eun Tak, Mr. Reaper, and Sunny) have all reincarnated, but Kim Shin is not apart of Mr. Reaper's or Sunny's new life, but they end up together again. Him and Eun Tak meet up again in Canada when she is 19 again. It ends with them seeing each other again.My faults with this ending is in the bigger picture, was what he did that awful to deserve this bad of a punishment? Even the Reaper, who is Wang Yeo, has his punishment ended and can move on. It's also stated several times that you have 4 lives, and they should all be on their 3rd or 4th. So Kim Shin gets to continue and live on even after they can't come back anymore. Just a sad and flat ending for all of the build up.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

In my opinion, the story was stretched unnecessarily, and it felt like forever, rather painful to watch through certain scenes.  It got so annoying at one point that I nearly considered dropping this drama. Adding to that the whole age gap thing just felt pretty weird to me, the kissing scenes pulled the whole 'romance' out of the scene. I just couldn't take the 'love' part seriously for the first couple of episodes, it just felt very out of place? I dropped this after episode 13. But alas, I eventually had to go back. The awesome soundtrack and acting couldn't get out of my mind. The top-notched 'bromance' kept getting me curious about how the Reaper-Goblin relationship will grow and bloom into Episode 16.For my money, the story was pretty decent. The bromance and the funny scenes added to an amazing experience. The acting was phenomenal and I LOVED every part of it. I'd be lying if I say I didn't want to see more of the story centered around certain side characters. Some felt like they deserved more screentime. Kim's General's reincarnation is a good example. Seeing his story, him happy with his family, living in comfort, possibly with Kim looking at him and iconically smiling would've been pretty satisfactory. The Reaper and Sunny scenes towards the end were SATISFYING. The best part after the bromance.Goblin decided to have an open ending, which I would say was a pretty good idea. Despite wanting to know more about what happened to Goblin and the bride after they met again in Canada. I believe the open ending was more effective in leaving a strong impression on its viewers than a closed one. Ultimately being one of the elements that helped the show get a strong ending. Lastly, I wish there was some form of indirect interaction between the Reaper and the Goblin towards the very end. Leaving a ""Some friendships are so strong, they can even transcend lifetimes"" taste in the mouth, but well, guess it's too good to be true. I didn't initially plan on giving a high rating to this drama on MDL, but I am an emotional creature and the last 2 episodes got me good.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I don't have an issue with it as he is meant to be like 900 years old so it's whatever. The issue I had is that the female lead acted like a literal 12 year old for most of the movie.Again, she's meant to be like 18 or whatever, which some people already had an issue with, but why did she act so child-like the whole movie? It was super annoying and gave me the creeps. Like, a little part of me hated on him for liking her when she's like that, but mostly it was just her behavior that gave me the creeps.I honestly only finished this because Lee Dong Wook is my absolute favorite actor ever and the bromance between him and Gong Yoo's character was AMAZING. Female lead is the reason for the 9/10 above, and despite her being super cringey, I would totally re-watch this just to experience the bromance again.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The plot of this story, considering just the Goblin's roommates, lends itself to so many funny, melancholy, and contemplative moments.  The reaper, expertly played by LEE DONG WOOK,  is a nice guy who offers the dead forgetting tea in a quaint room before they go through a lovely door to the afterlife.  The goblin, Kim Shin, exquistely portrayed by GONG YOO, is a sympathic and lovable character with regrets of his past and a desire to protect the ones he loves.  The girl who should not have lived, Ji Eun Tak, masterfully played by KIM GO EUN, is so lovable and level-heaed in this sometimes chaotic and fantastical story. The restaurant’s owner, Sunny, beautifully portrayed by Yoo In Na, is an eclectic and interesting character.

Make me watch more than 1h per episode, it's quite tormented. Haha... It always bored me at some point.... And as I predict, some episodes of this drama quite bored for me, those episodes make me feel when this will end and continue to the next one... Haha... So yeah, that's quite lowering the score for this drama for me. But of course there're also some episode that can evoke my emotion, so yeah it quite help the score for this drama. Story about Kim Shin (KS) a general that's curse to be a goblin, due to his sin of killing innocent person just because he's stubborn & want to approach the king... With that curse, KS live immortality to wait for his bride to be born to kill him. After 900 years, KS help a woman & her baby, and with that decision, KS made his destiny, cause the baby that he saved is his bride...19 years later, KS meet Ji Eun Tak (ET), the baby that he saved & also his bride. ET can see ghost as long as she remembered, and all the ghost always greet her as the goblin's bride. Cause when KS saved her, he also give her a mark & that mark indicate that ET indeed is the goblin's bride. But that's mean everything went smoothly for KS & ET...? Of course not. ET has prove herself as the goblin's bride for KS, and little by little KS & ET are getting closer & closer to each other. They start to prove they're indeed the soulmate for each other & little by little their feeling for each other also grown into full blossom... So... How their relationship ended in the end...? Can they avoid the fact that ET born to kill KS...?I think that's pretty much the story without giving any spoiler. Haha... Now let's talk about what I like and don't.What I like:+ The chemistry between Gong Yoo & Kim Go Eun. They quite suitable for each other. + Gong Yoo & Kim Go Eun are good actor/ess. I can see how captivated KS of ET from KS's first glaze of ET. And the grow of their relationship. How devastated when ET has to lose KS. Everything portrayed perfectly...+ The interesting story of Grim Reaper & Sunny. Really funny to see Grim Reaper act like an idiot when they first met...What I don't like:- The long duration of each episode...- The unclear Samshin Lady... Who the heck is this lady. See even MDL don't give the name to her... At first I thought she is the GOD, but turn out no... So who the heck is this lady...?????Overall, this just another drama for my list. TianD said, ""Goblin is a hit or miss."" For me this is a miss.. Haha... And really until I finished write this, I even don't know what score to give this drama. So a little fair warning, I can still change the score many months from now... Haha....  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

It’s about life and loss; joy and grief; hope and despair. It’s about letting go of the past to embrace the present and future; building a friendship with a rival; falling in love for the first time. It is, as Eun-tak says, a “sad love” story. Yet despite this show being an absolutely bewitching and bittersweet story, it didn’t quite work for me.❤ This show works best when it focuses on the four main leads - Kim Shin, Grim Reaper, Ji Eun-tak, and Sunny. Kim Shin and the Grim Reaper shine whether they are bickering or bantering.❤ It took me some time to get invested in the love story considering an immortal is attempting to romance a high school senior. I embraced their romance eventually, but it took me some time to get past the circumstances. Eun-tak’s sunny personality mixed with Kim Shin’s awakening emotions were the perfect mixture between silly and sweet.❤ It’s too long for such a short story. Whole scenes from previous episodes we’re inserted into later episodes to pad it out to sixteen episodes, but it dragged down the pacing dramatically. I think it could have been well executed with half the run time.❤ The person training to be the next assistant to Kim Shin, Yoo Duk-hwa, was only used as a plot device or the comic relief. The CGI was also pretty terrible, particularly in the earlier episodes.❤ Be prepared for a bittersweet ending. This is a show that talks a lot about depression, loss, and grief. If you’re looking for a fun and feel good show, you might not enjoy this experience right now.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

As I said in the title, I postponed Goblin for so long after my friend recommended it to me dozens of times. I just couldn't bring myself to watch it for two reasons:-1) Is it really as good as everyone is saying or will I be very disappointed?2)Heard it will make you cry a lot which I wanted to avoid at all costs because I absolutely don't like Tragic or Sad stories. Life is complex enough. Why should we watch dramas which are sad too?For the above questions the answers I found are:-1) Yes it really is as good as everyone is saying. I can truly see the magic of this Kdrama and why it so beloved by so many. This is one of those few Kdramas which is truly an experience to be felt and seen by all and I will highly recommend anyone who hasn't watch it yet to watch when it feels right or when you find the time. You will love it for the friendships all the people in this world share, the trials they faced and overcame, the beauty of their love, the tragedy in lives which will make us weep for them, the characters and the actors who played them, the music and even the end. IT IS ALL WORTH IT!2)This is not just a sad drama for the sake of being sad. It truly is an experience and though I cried, I am also happy I got to experience the beauty of this drama. Also, it's not completely sad. Life is beautiful and it is shown in this drama. Also love the mini stories of the people the Grim Reaper sends to the afterlife. Don't be intimidated by the sad ending like I was when I heard of it. All in all just give this Kdrama a chance like I did and Trust me you won't regret it. It has the perfect blend of happiness, comedy, heartfelt emotional scenes and sadness just like our lives but in a more fantasy setting.Goblin truly is One of a Kind  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

So I'm glad that I wasn't. I've been doing an immortal-beings-falling-in-love binge, and this is where I arrived at after a sequence of DAYS, Del Luna, A Korean Odyssey, and Destined With You. Unfortunately, I'm not the kind of person who can watch something that's almost purely romance, so the first 9 episodes were bit of a drag for me. The peak of the show for me was 12-13-14 where most of the important things happen, and I enjoyed those episodes enough for me to look past the sweet albeit boring beginning, so I suppose I ended up being more forgiving with ratings. And while I was satisfied with the ending, I wasn't quite happy with it. It was good, but had had potential to be great. Also, I'm fundamentally not made for age-difference, and I could never fully enjoy the fluff either because that thought was constantly on my mind. Maybe why my favorite part of their romance was 14-15-16 (minus the ending).   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I watched it because it had so much good ratings. What a disappointment. The story begins with a plot that is classical and plain. There is the overused trope of fate and as soon as Eun Tak meets the Goblin the love story is forebode. But that's okay, it's well done and their firts encounters with both of them searching any interest in a potential relation is interesting ( she wants to use him to escape her life while he wants to use her to die ).However, it does not get better. The rythm is too slow, and the side love story between the Gream Reaper and the shop owner is boring and useless. Even the bromance is not that good. The transition between being ennemies to friends is not smooth. The whole stuff of reincarnations is so bad as well. Kim shin is shown as a bright man ( he won a lot of battles because of physical strengh but also by strategical means ) yet he does not make the difference between his sister and her new life ?? Furthermore at the end every reincarnated people have the same face as their previous life body, yet it had been specified that people randomly reincarnate into different bodies and having the same is rare.The backstory of the medieval plot is thin as well and the characters are not fully developped.The final fight with the main ennemy is failed as it is teased for some episodes ( and visually he is scary and charismatic, his dark tongue gives goosebumps ). But why is he killed with almost no fight ?? Kim Shin awaited more than 1000 years for 30min of dodging ?? And the 3 last episodes, a disaster.Kim shin finally dying wassad but actually it was a logical ending : he was released from his suffering and allowed to live happily by embracing love at the very end of his existance. Eun Tak would cherish her memories of him and mourn him knowing that he left peacefully.Making her die at his place is such a nonsense. First she embodied the future as the younger character. Second, it means that Kim Shin will never die, and that it was a punishment of god ( rather than a way to relieve him from his pains ). Not only did he suffer for years because of the betrayal of the King, but now he has to eternally suffer from the lost of his wife. What is the moral of that ? ""No matter what you do to repent you will suffer ?"" It does not make sense since  we know that the sinner is the Grim Reaper and not Kim Shin. On the whole it is not the worse drama ever, but it lacks in many points. It is still fully watchable, the characters are attaching, and the fate of the Goblin is touching : we want to know how he will find some happiness.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I really liked it but the drama got some flaws that are hard to just overlook.   Story: I liked the story. It was actually pretty interesting and different in a way. Some would say that the age gap between the 2 main character is hard to overlook but it was okay for me. What I mean is I wasn't really paying attention to that part as the drama is based around something fictional, the age gap is just a part of that.  I like the relation between the two main characters but also with the second couple. The bromance was also a very good part of that drama. I just wish Deok Hwa played a bigger part of the drama. Usually, there are some characters that I don't like in a drama, like a big villain but I just liked every characters here. And also, I enjoyed everything regarding the Grim Reapers organization and especially the Grim Reaper (Lee Dong Wook).  Acting/Cast: They all did a great job and I think they all suited their role. Gong Yu as always is a very good actor. I was also very surprised by Lee Dong Wook, if was just perfect as the Grim Reaper. Also, Kim Go Eun is a good actress (that I saw in Cheese in the Trap before) but rather than feeling sad with her when she cried (near the end) I was just impressed. I usually don't like the cryings in dramas also so seeing Lee Dong Wook always with teary eyes/crying was kind of hard for me but he did a good job! I also often find the main female lead annoying but she was okay.   Music: I think Goblin wouldn't have been that great without this OST. Seriously, the music in the drama was just perfect. All the songs were just beautiful. If the music wasn't that good, I think I would have rated the drama 7.5 instead of 8.5.   Rewatch value: I would probably not rewatch it, or I would skip some parts. The episodes are unnecessarily long.   So why do I think Goblin is overrated?  - There are tons of flashbacks and they are ALWAYS the SAME!!! That was SOOOO annoying! I hate when they do that in dramas. Like they would put the same flashback twice in the same episode and in almost episode... And for what? We didn't forget that happened so why? This is why the episodes are long but it is just long of flashback I think... It could have been maybe 10 minutes shorter if it wasn't for that... - Then, that wouldn't really affect the rating but it kind of annoyed me to some point.. The product placement here it just too strong. So we can see it everywhere and in every drama but usually it's more subtle than that. They were literally saying: eat SUBWAY and your life will be better. (or something like that). I understand that they needed money to have that good quality in the scenes but come on... - Then I feel like the story/plot could have been better used... It is kind of a waste of the characters I think. And I wanted to know more about the deities.   So yeah, I'm happy I watched it but I wished the realization of the drama and the use of the characters would have been better handled. When I finished the drama I had a bitter feeling. I enjoyed it and really liked it but I felt like the potential was a bit wasted. So I think there are many more stuff to talk about regarding that drama but I'll just stop here :)   Anyways, Goblin is a drama that need to be seen ! :)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

It was very well produced, detail oriented I may say. I think Gong Yoo, Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In-Na did a really great job. The spotlights, to me at least, were on the relationship between the goblin and the grim reaper. Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In-Na were a great couple full of chemistry. I like the story, I think it was well developed, except for one thing only: they could have explored Kim Go-eun better. Her character was way too childish for the age (I don't know if it has any difference in Korea, but here in the Eastern 19 yo girls are more mature than that). The childish behaviour turned the love story a little weird.  Besides that, I think it's a good production and deserves to be watched and appreciated. I had lots of fun.

I've always been a Gong Yoo stan since his Coffee Prince days, so there's no way I'm letting this show go without me watching it. Before I met oppa Ji Chang Wook, because of Gong Yoo's hiatus in the drama land, my heart got swayed, but he will always remain as my first love. LOL. Obviously, he's the main reason I watched this show. And to add icing to the cake, the writer is Kim Eun Sook! I personally believe she's one of the best rom-com writers out there. What I love most about this drama is their comedic antics especially between goblin and the grim reaper. Their chemistry is on point, even much better than the chemistry between goblin and his bride. Sadly, for me, GY and Kim Go Eun didn't have that much chemistry. But don't get me wrong, their acting is good. It's just that they don't have that vibrant chemistry. Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na's chemistry is even better than them! So love their love story.<3Some say, the series went downhill after ep 14 and the ending was forced and I somewhat, quite agree. But I also don't know how to end it any other way that would satisfy the viewers, so I have accepted the ending as good enough. Rewatch Value - If I will watch this again, I will only watch this because of goblin and grim reaper. And Sung Jae, too! lolP.S. This drama has one of the best soundtracks ever! I Will Go to You Like the First Snow lyrics is so heartbreaking. I also love how the writer added a poetic touch to the script.:)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"michelleoc","/profile/michelleoc","Nov 13, 2020","1","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    Watch this show!  My first k-drama, and one I revisit periodically.  The storyline is original -  a man destined to continue living to atone for crimes in his past.  I'd like to address the age difference - I can see why some people really had a problem with it, especially since she spent so much time in a high school uniform.  However, the chemistry between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun was amazing.  When watching Gong Yoo - his loneliness was almost palpable and was heartbreaking to see.  Kim Go Eun was able to vacillate back and forth between her pitiful life and her vivacity as she gets to know Kim Shin (Yoo) better.  The secondary love story between Lee Dong Wook and Eu In Na was lovely as well.  There was a lot of humor (like when he told her his name was Kim Woo Bin!), but such sadness as well.  The scenery is just beautiful when they are in Canada.  The music is absolutely perfect.  Each song fit perfectly where it was used and there was a haunting quality about a number of the songs.  These songs are easily recognizable when you hear them outside of the show.   But I think the thing that I love best about this show is the friendships between the characters, especially between Goblin and Reaper.   If you look up the word Bromance in the dictionary, you should find their pictures there - what started out as hate, moved to grudging respect, and then finally brotherly love.  Their scenes never failed to make me laugh.  This is one of the few shows that I have watched multiple times, and have enjoyed it just as much each time.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Audrie","/profile/acantabile","Feb 22, 2017","3","9.5","Overall 9.5    Story 10 Acting/Cast 9.5 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Goblin is one of those dramas that was highly anticipated right after the much loved DOTS due to these dramas coming from the same writer- and Goblin is deserving of this hype as it has everything you want- from romance to suspense to comedy. Goblin truly wrapped everything together nicely in order to deliver an enjoyable and heart-wrenching drama.  THE GOOD I loved the plot line- and the unique synopsis of an immortal goblin needing to find his wife to finally end his life after years of suffering as he teams up with the Grim Reaper to unravel lost secrets. Of course- romance, mystery and suspense all ties up together with this- and it was beautifully played out. The plot was a bit easy to predict yet it was still full of suspense and plot twists that may throw you in a loop, but it was obvious what will happen in the end as in all of the writer's previous dramas.   Even so, there were quite a few plot twists that will make you on the edge of your seat as usually major developments happen within the last few minutes of each episode that just makes me want to tear out of hair!  The music was plain amazing. It fit so well with the drama as every-time a certain melody came up, I was tearing up already so it deserves a perfect 10 for me.  Setting aside the obvious love story between the goblin and his wife, I looked so forward to the bromance between the grim reaper and goblin and how they slowly begrudgingly became friends as their antics and scenes were hilarious. The second romance between the reaper and Sunny was heart-wrenching yet I was invested in their relationship from the start to finish. The actors and actresses were amazing- and I loved everyone's acting- although I did find Goblin's bi-polar personality a bit confusing and slightly annoying due to his character switching up all the time.  There were some comments on Eun Tak's character and how many were annoyed that her character was so young, and I am no exception to these slight feelings of confusion- however that disappeared as Eun Tak was perfect; depicting a naive yet bright optimistic 19 year old who struggled throughout her life, yet still manages to see the bright side of things. To add- everyone probably heard about how Lee Dong Wook had pestered/frequently visited the writer in order to get his role- and he was deserving of that. He played the grim reaper beautifully as he really knew how to show angst and pain through one look.   THE BAD There's not much to say about the bad things- other than the weird 'out of character' moments at times. I do find the drama a bit slow near the middle as everything happened quickly within the first few episodes (which is pretty common).   The amount of product placements within this drama is overwhelming- to the point where it was getting a bit more irritating, but I guess it's fine as dramas do need sponsorships and needs to show their gratitude  I was also disappointed that the secondary characters (Secretary Kim, Chairman Yu, the mysterious grandma and especially Deok Hwa) didn't have much screentime nearing the mid-way point as I enjoyed their characters.  AND SO? Despite the small annoyances you may find- you should really watch Goblin as it's a unique drama that is truly deserving of the high ratings as not only the OSTs are outstandingly beautiful- everything about this drama will temporary satisfy every drama-lover's insatiable hunger!!

The suspense and excitement is maintained even till the last. You totally fall in love with romance, comic scenes, action and all of  those elements. Its a throughout entertainment and the story doesn't drops low anywhere, each episode and scene is worth watching.  Acting/Cast: Such big actors wih their flawless acting will make you love each and every character they play. Gong Yoo being a serious goblin and happy soul both are interesting, Kim Go Eun is so cute and adorable in this drama, Lee Dong Wook alert! you might have a SLS problem here, Yoo Na In is damn good also adding glam to the drama and Yook Sung Jae adds up to the comic portion, even the minor characters act great.   Music: OST is great and totally suits the on going situation in the drama.   Re-watch value: Yes you can actually watch it again and I definitely will.   So I can totally conclude that this drama should be watched, it will make you laugh, cry, feel relaxed and totally thrilled.

I was curious to see what the buzz is about since this drama garnered an international fanfare &  the god/deity-human relationship seems to be popular in dramas in recent years although the storyline of ‘ancient man-being’ meets ‘pitiful young woman’ seems to be overwrought in Kdrama land. The show definitely had a big budget as to why they were able to do many things from CGI visual effects, costumes, set production & film location. But money can only do you so much if your writing is stale as a burnt toast with bland & forced characterization. This show relies a lot on aesthetic. Gong Yoo is an excellent actor but his role here is so drab. He’s a 900 year old goblin but talks & acts like an insolent teen-man. First time watching Kim Go Eun. I’m not a fan of the childlike mannerism or kiddish voice. It’s a bit overdone & comes off unnatural. The opening sequence of Kim Shin’s backstory is great. The only part worth watching. Fast-forward to the present, Kim Shin realizes his fate is tied to a poor teenager. Eun Tak’s financial woes is suddenly fixed by an ancient rich man & Kim Shin’s life problems is at the stakes of a teenage girl. This doesn’t make an interesting dynamic. I’m not buying KS & ET ‘fated’ relationship or romance. It’s ridiculous. There wasn’t any development to begin with for them to feel remotely attracted to each other romantically. It’s all too superficial given that they were complete strangers from the get go. The development is totally inorganic. No chemistry between the actors nor the characters. The dialogue is insufferable with repetitive & dull scenes with a cast of characters that does nothing interesting. Everyone is just walking around looking pretty & talking without any depth. The playback of the flashback scenes is redundant. The comedy is cringeworthy with unintentional laughable moments in a not-so-good way.The only saving grace for the show is the stunning cinematography and great OST. The directing is overly melodramatic with a plot barely half-baked.Also, the product placement is so apparent, the drama reads like an ad commercial.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I was so captivated by Gong Yoo's(Goblin) pain and Kim Go Eun's(Ji Eun Tak as Goblin's Bride) emptiness and hardships.  The great thing about this drama is that even if you knew where the plot is going, you still enjoy the acting. I can feel Gong Yoo's(Goblin) anxiety on how to tell Kim Go Eun(Goblin's bride) that he liked her and that he wants to be with her constantly, that he worries every time for Kim Go Eun(Goblin's bride), when she's not anywhere near his sight and he's always there for her to save her and go anywhere with her.  The setting of this drama... I can never ever say anything bad about it. You're in the maple country, you can see the beautiful maple trees, the sign of autumn, how can I forget how beautiful that was? Add the beautiful OSTS this drama have, as well as the 2nd male lead(Lee Dong-wook as Grim Reapear) and 2nd female lead Yoo In-na(Sunny/Sun Hee). How can something go wrong?  I felt like I was watching this live, and I was there on the set with them especially when the episode 13 came up where in I cried so hard as Kim Go Eun(Goblin's bride) cried her heart out. I was really caught up with the scene and I salute Kim Go Eun's cries in there. It felt so real that you can really think she's crying for her real life love.  This will be one of the drama's I will never ever forget. I don't expect less from Gong Yoo's acting since Coffee Prince. He's one of the most sought after actor and I always look forward to his works.

"Camelot","/profile/animeincamelot","Nov  4, 2017","2","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      This drama was one of the most beautiful pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. If you are at all hesitating to watch this drama due to overhype or worry about the genre I beg you watch it. It changed my entire perspective on what a kdrama could be. I am sad I can't go back to rewatch it for the first time, to experience it anew, again and again. That first watching is truly magic. To allow yourself to experience this drama is a gift.Allow me to expand on some of the specifics of why Goblin was life changing. If you know me you know that I am obsessed with character and character development. This drama is chock-full of amazingly written characters and all go through massive transformations. The stagnation in the Goblin and Grim Reaper's lives disappears when they meet their soul mates. As a plot device this use of love and lovers is refreshing as it is definitely the men who change for their love (instead of the usual over-accommodating woman who plagues dramaland). Aside from character there is the aesthetic. Goblin had a massive budget and it is clearly seen in every facet of the drama. The cinematography deserves unending praise, the acting is of the highest quality, the plotline is refreshingly unique. Their sets, wardrobes, worlds are immersive in the utmost. The atmosphere these minor details create lends itself perfectly to the story and makes the mood created by the actors and writers to be all the more real. Goblin's melancholy, something that so many dramas try and fail to achieve, was breathtaking. As I have said before I love sad dramas. This drama made me cry every episode, and not because it was ridiculously melodramatic. Most of the time it was the side stories I cried over (the Grim Reaper's side plots). These stories, so superfluous to the main plot, show the exacting attention to detail that was used in this drama. They were moving, beautiful, heartbreaking stories and they left you feeling both empty and full. Full of life and a love for humanity. Goblin's greatest achievement, in my opinion, is empathy. Every character (or at least every character we don't necessarily hate) can be empathized with. Every episode you can change who you most identify with and yet never feel disconnected from any other character. This is a feat so difficult to accomplish that I have only ever encountered it in Anna Karenina before.I know this review wasn't the most informative but I feel that the emotional response to Goblin that I and so many others felt is the best possible recommendation and review I can give.

And of course, I know I'm not allowed to spoil anything, as I understand that there are still some people who haven't watched this yet. But what could be more important than this?! Actually, don't answer that. I'm well aware of the fact that there are far more important things to take care of.But anyway, I think this drama definitely deserves all of the attention it's been garnering. With a storyline as unique as this one, it's no wonder people find it so refreshing.  Plus, the cinematography is just beyond amazing, making me especially envious of the fact that I don't get to live in their so-called reality. The villain, however, was introduced a little too late in my opinion. I would've loved to see him earlier on in the series.On the other hand, the chemistry on this set was absolutely incredible. I'm super thankful because it was for this reason that these actors were able to grace us with so many fantastic ad-libs to look back on in the first place. All of the actors/actresses had their fair share of memorable moments but ultimately, I don't think anything will ever compare to the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper.Even though the original soundtracks did a fine job at capturing its overall theme, there are only a few that I could actually see myself listening to outside of this drama. That isn't to say that the music was bad. It just didn't fall under my preferences. The soft ballads, however, felt like whispers of the heart: soft yet powerful. And for those, I loved every second of it.Overall, I had an interesting time being taken on this emotional rollercoaster. Unfortunately, I wasn't nearly as satisfied with the ending as I was with the rest of this drama. At first, it seemed like a happy ending but the more I seemed to think about it, the sadder it truly was. It's sort of like the feeling you get when you receive a delicious-looking cookie, but the taste just doesn't turn out as good as it looks. As far as recommendations go, I would still encourage people to give this drama a try. And although I wish I was given a better ending, it's not bad enough to the point where I wouldn't rewatch it. With that said,Llama out.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I started writing just a brief comment but got a little emotional as my love for this drama came pouring out.When watching K dramas without knowing their year of release, you can often sense if a drama comes before/after Goblin. This masterpiece ushered in new standards of storytelling scope, production values and cinematography to Korean dramas and everyone else scrambled to keep up. From the first frame to last it feels like you're watching a top-drawer movie with every scene perfectly composed, framed and lit. The Goblin's house itself (a character all in it's own right) is a masterpiece of endlessly interesting set-design and dressing, but the exteriors also, whether they be the many fantasy/historical sequences or more mundane Seoul streets are all realised with loving care and attention to detail. And don't get me started on the Canadian scenes...The casting too is utterly perfect; Kim Go Eun is the ultimate girl-next-door type (옆집 소녀 ha!), Gong Yoo with his masterful ability to go from hard-as-nails-hero to tender suitor, right down to Yook Sung Jae's fragile naivety. And that's before we get to Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na's perfect ""second couple"" - so successful they spawned a spin-off industry that's been going ever since.The OSTs are easily a match for the high standard of the visuals. I own the double-CD pack of this and still play it nearly every day 2 years after first watching. Everyone has their favourite OST song from Goblin, but the Ailee classic remains one of the absolute high water marks of Korean drama OSTs.Goblin remains an utter game changer in K-drama and the first few seconds of this video (Kim Go Eun's crying scene) are part of the reason why. I stumbled upon this video in a bored moment and the emotions instantly came flooding back and I welled up with tears, not just from the raw moment shown here (a Kim Go Eun acting masterclass), but from the lifelong memories given to me by this wonderful wonderful drama.I know it will sound ridiculously over the top, but for me at least, television was never the same again.

I love their acting on the sad scenes, I mean, they made me moved and cry. 2. The music is PERFECT because it really fits in specific scenes. The background music adds that tension, depressed and happy feelings. If the scenes made me cry, the added background music made me cry more. 3. I think the plot is good :) The bromance is good too.  Now the not-so-good things: 1. There are some parts that I don't feel the romantic connection between the Goblin and the High School Girl. I don't know why, but I just don't feel it (I even love the connection between the Grim Reaper and the Chicken Restaurant Owner than the 2 leads), but during the middle till the end (especially when the lead girl character is 29 y/o), I am feeling their connection and I liked it. 2. I don't like the thing where they add something (like a recap) on some episodes that makes it damn long, I even have to skip it, sorry but I'm an impatient person. 3. I love the sad scenes more than some scenes, because in some scenes, I got bored a little bit (I used my phone during the boring scenes, which means that I really got bored). I was not interested (a bit) on the flashbacks (idk why, sorry D: )  My rewatch value is 7 because I could watch it again, but I'm that type of person who doesn't want to watch depressing scenes again because I don't want to cry a lot.  Overall, I think the drama is great! I cannot count how many times I cried in just this drama.. Probably 30 or 40 LOL. Because most of the scenes really made me cry.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I agree with criticisms regarding the slow pacing of the plot (particularly from episodes 5-7) and excessive product placements, but besides all of that, ""Goblin"" was able to deliver a refreshing plot backed up by A+ acting, masterful directing and cinematography, and wonderful OSTs, that these shortcomings barely became bothersome at all. Congratulations to Kim Eun Sook for finally writing something that deserves all the hype (contrary to popular opinion, I didn't find her previous hits as compelling and deserving, but that's just me). The plot needed some more polishing but overall is cohesive, profound and compelling. A show that you will definitely watch more than once, just to catch the subtle clues and foreshadowing that you missed when you saw it for the first time.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Cactus28","/profile/asmaa28","May 19, 2017","2","8.0","Overall 8.0    Story 7.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 5.0      If you're wondering whether you should watch it or not, you definitely SHOULD. The Plot is all over the place and could've been much better. I still don't quite get why Gong Yoo should be a Goblin. The main Antagonist feels very weak and kind of unnecessary the show could've done without him altogether. They seem to complicate things far more than they should for no reason. The age gap between the two main couple annoyed me at first since both of them are great actors but they do much better when they have a partner with sizzling chemistry but I chose to ignore it and just enjoy it. The acting and the comedy makes up for some of the plot holes. I sometimes wished they would've gotten the fantasy genre out of the drama altogether because they seemed like they couldn't commit much to it. They wanted the Goblin and the Grim reaper's powers without all the complicated background.However, despite all this I finished it yesterday and I felt so sad I couldn't sleep. The soundtrack is really beautiful and all the character's acting is top notch. It felt like I've been watching this for a lot longer than just 16 episodes, which makes sense, since one episode is an hour and a half basically. I think the best way to enjoy this kind of Drama is to not get too worked up about what's going to happen at the end but to fully enjoy the scenes in every episode and treat it as a single movie. The two main male characters are my favorite thing in the drama. They even have more friendly/brotherly chemistry than the main couple. Gong Yoo is amazing as usual, I can't get over how well he can really portray every single emotion with just his eyes. Lee Dong Wook was adorable here. I love the two female leads as well they did a great job.  I loved every character presented here Mr. Kim the secratary, Yu Chairman and Deok Hwa were so adorable and such scene stealers. This is probably my favorite ensemble cast for 2017.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I have been waiting for the finale just for me to see what will really happen although at the back of my mind I knew it already!  I would say I have a mixed impressions on the finale and the total drama itself.  One thing for sure this drama has captured the hearts of many kdrama viewers.  It has the perfect production value, cinematography, writing and character development!  The acting of everybody are just excellent!  I salute especially Kim Go Eun as Ji-Eun Tak the bride of the Goblin.  Her acting is fantastic, controlled and natural.  She has matured dramatically from the last time I watched her in Cheese in the Trap.  And she is just young and yet she can act incredibly good!  Gong Yoo, Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In-ha  also did a remarkable acting performance.   Let us go to the story.  It has one of the most uniquely written story!  Every plot made sense!  The writer successfully made an attempt to inject many light hearted scenes to balance off the very serious theme of the drama.  And this is what that mixed impressions that I am saying.  This is very sad story, bittersweet and depressing!  Even tough we get a happy ending ( opps possible spoiler here) it is still not a happy ending at all!  Because we know that Goblin is an immortal being and after the life of the bride, Goblin stays behind and still feel sad and lonely! He will still be a wanderer alone and it hurts me to think that until when will he be living? But the central theme is the selling point of this drama,  that love will see you through beyond the borders of eternity!  I just want to say this, and perhaps I belong to the minorities, I cant really see the connections between the lead!  I dont see any romance maybe because i see them as siblings perhaps or just an uncle-niece relationship!  Blame the age gap of the leads!  I just cant seem to connect with them as well.  The music is incredibly amazing!  I love how they were put in the drama!  It gives the fantasy feel!  I like most of them.  Because of its depressing tone I will only do selective rewatching like the bromance scenes of the 2 lead actors!    Overall, this is highly recommended drama.  Good acting, story and script!  Worth my 16 hours of viewing.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

"purplebass","/profile/purplebass","Jan 27, 2017","2","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 7.5 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 9.0 Rewatch Value 8.0      I started watching this drama because of the talented writer and Lee Dong Wook, and not because it was a ""hit"", and I've liked it ever since the first episode. The story felt ""new"" in terms of K-Drama, because not all fantasy projects are crafted well, but it is a classic plot re-imagined in a different way, so nothing really new. It is a simple story twisted in different ways all over again. Yes, this is how a writer works, but what I once thought would turn out to be something unpredictable, has turned to be a plot I had already seen in the drama itself. Let me explain: the story is simple and ever since the beginning the audience knows what's to come, the problem is how to ""solve"" the main issue without ending the show how you expect it. In a way, the writer managed to do that, but on another side, she didn't, because even as I followed the show while it was on-air, I predicted long ago what would happen. Perhaps having read so many fantasy books influenced me, that is what I want to think. In my mind I kept saying ""please don't go to that route and surprise me"" but I was disappointed in the last episodes because some plots and characters were introduced too late or not given the space they deserved, as if the writer thought about their fate too late and there wasn't time to fix that. While the mix between historical drama flashbacks and present time filled with the cute moments between the main couple and the other characters and the bromance between Goblin and Grim Reaper was comic, I felt as if the writer spent more time on the banter than on the actual plot, and some episodes felt like a filler, especially the last 3. But overall, it's an enjoyable story.  Have both my favorite actor Lee Dong Wook and Gong Yoo (this is the 1st drama I watch with him in it) as the male leads - because as Kim Eun Sook proved in her other dramas, she can give enough screentime to more than one actor - was a pleasant experience. They have great chemistry, their bromance was awesome and it sometimes overshadowed the main couple. I lived for their bickering, they brought me to tears and this doesn't happen much. Needless to say their acting was great. I loved LDW as the Grim Reaper and he moved me a lot, he was really fit to play a serious and a bit depressed immortal angel of death. Gong Yoo was also a surprise, since this is my first drama with him. I felt like he brought peace o the set, I don't know. He gives me the aura of a heartwarming person. I'm a bit torn about Kim Go Eun. She is believable as a 19 year old even though sometimes she used too much aegyo. OK that she's still a teen, but tone it down a bit, gurl. Like I said, her chemistry with Gong Yoo was there but there were times I didn't feel as much for Goblin/Eun Tak couple as I did for Goblin/Grim Reaper. Perhaps it was the age gap that made them give the feel of dad-daughter or oppa-dongsaeng, because it depended on the moment. Eun Tak could go to 19 year old to wise girl in a heartbeat and the Goblin could act like a small child one moment and like a mature guy the next. Overall, though, they are balanced in my opinion. And I liked that in many moments in the second half of the drama where they had to film kisses or couple-y scenes, they seemed very comfortable acting as a couple. Yoo In Na was perfect as a beautiful BBQ shop owner. She was witty and funny and I loved her sense of fashion. I also liked Yook Sung Jae as Deok Hwa.  The music was great, you can tell they spent a nice deal of money and time to make it good.  In general, I would say that this drama is for fantasy lovers the most with a side of romantic comedy. If you're looking for something mysterious, there are few questions you're gonna ask yourself indeed, but is not complicated like a melo. Let's just say, the story is simple and the message the author wants to convey is too.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Stranded","/profile/Stranded","Feb 16, 2017","2","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 10 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 8.0 Rewatch Value 5.0      This is my second Kdrama review and I try to keep it short. Goblin is a must watch K-drama, but taken slow. Not in once, because of the complicated stories of the characters.  My facts are here:  Positive:  - Great storyline - one of a kind in K-dramas till now. I learned a lot about Korean people's beliefs. - Great friendship between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook. I loved every moment of their communication. It seemed they're friends in real life - Great chemistry between Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na. The love between their characters was very well acted as if they're couple in real life. I loved every moment of their relationship. - The Goblin character is really complicated and I liked it very much.. It's well played. But I fell for Grim Reaper Character - it;s also very complicted and I loved it in every single moment even more. - The emotions that Gong Yoo and Yoo In Na were like  they're real brother and sister.  They are great actors and so is Lee Dong Wook. - No loopholes and more realistic ending..   Negative:  - Lack of Chemistry between the goblin and his bride. Mostly of her part, the actress Kim Go Eun just didn't do well in my opinon. She didn't put her heart in the role and it seemed out of place.  This is way I don't give 10 to this Drama.  When Gong Yoo showed passion and deep emotions, she didn't respond and it seemed forced. I don't think I will watch another drama with Kim Go Eun. - Time loops withous some kind of explaination what happened those years - Yoo in Na parting with Grim reaper. I couldn't understand if she died after she ""left"""". If she didn;t die why nobody looked for her?   I liked Goblin I watched it slow to understand better the things. So, if you wonder to watch it, do it, but take 1 or 2 episode per day for example. The producer and writer of this Drama are great, but they shouldn't concentrate too much on the tears. Characters moved on with their lives, that should be shown. I  will rewatch this drama some time in the future.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I usually like a lot of ost but this one was so good i had to download them and listened to them on repeat for a good 2 weeks after i finished the whole drama!   all in all this is a drama you will not regret watching honestly. the best drama of the year so far and i'll be honest i don't think anything will top this for a while for me personally!

The drama appears to be heralded as one of (if not 'The') best Korea has to offer, which I'm quite surprised about.  Six episodes into the show, I expected the pace to have quickened and the story to have developed further.  To me it appears as though the writer created a promising premise, and an interesting universe, but did not think deeply about the  main conflict of the story and how that will pan out over 16 episodes. A story needs to have enough substance to be able to fill each episode effectively. 'The Goblin is cursed with immortality and only his bride can emancipate him from this anguish - but will she?' seems to be as far as the writer got. The painstaking process of waiting for her to make a decision is simply boring and holds no tension beyond 1 or 2 episodes. To me, the show appears to be all style, and no substance.I understand that not every drama needs to be fast-paced, or each episode does not need to end on a cliff-hanger for a drama to be good. Sometimes, the emotions between two people in love, or the lingering tension created by the threat of something tearing them apart, is enough to sustain interest from an audience. But this only works if the two main leads have undeniable chemistry. Unfortunately, the age difference between the leads kills all the chemistry, and makes it unsavory to watch. The female lead behaves even younger than she is while the Goblin appears too mature and stoic. I feel like I'm watching an Uncle supervise his niece as she frolics about like a child. Even Gong Yoo's superior good-looks is not enough the light the spark here. And I don't blame the actors either - they've done a good job with what they've been given. Of course, when we have an immortal being like the Goblin, his age difference should be irrelevant because eventually there will come a time when the girl will catch up to his age and surpass it. The writer could have used this idea to showcase a love-story that blossom over her lifetime. But alas, I don't think that's where the show is heading. I'll keep going for another episode but sadly, this one might be going into my Dropped pile.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

My Letterboxd review:""i will love this forever for introducing me to beloved gong yooas many problems as one could find with this series, my god do i love it so much. <3""I want to add on by saying this: this drama is incredible at evoking emotion and it does so in a way that feels wholly natural and fulfilling. It's genuinely beautiful. One moment I'd be in stitches laughing, and the next I'd be tearing up and crying as I felt for one of the characters. It's really amazing and I feel that this characteristic of the show is what really made it for me.As a side note: yes, the whole thing with Eun-tak being in high school is weird and I agree. But aside from that, I feel the show handles its subject matter with finesse and I don't think there was any harm intended in that choice.In any case...The cast is amazing, obviously. They have such great chemistry together regardless of the relationship between the characters. Of course, Yoo Gong and Go-Eun Kim were my favorite - not only are they both excellent performers, but they worked so well together! - but I also deeply appreciated the rest of the cast. All of them gave their performances their all, and because of that, they enhanced the story deeply and significantly contributed to bringing it to life.Naturally, I adored the characters as well.The story as a whole is really beautiful and led me to do a lot of thinking outside of the time I spent watching the show. I can safely credit this drama with solidifying my current perception of the afterlife (reincarnation is what I believe it could be) and honestly I thought that the way it discussed life and death was delicate and profound. I keep wanting to say the word ""beautiful"" as I describe this, but that's because it's true - all of it was beautiful to me. One of my favorite parts was how Dong-wook Lee's role as the Grim Reaper was explained and visualized. Simply marvelous.The music gets an easy and solid 10. I still listen to it every now and then and find it as timeless as it ever was.As a whole this drama is fantastic. It's definitely a bit of a time commitment but I found it to be VERY worth it. Do give it a chance because it certainly deserves it.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

No wonder she is by far one of the best actresses in the South Korea.  Gong Yoo as always needs no introduction on how good he is and has been in every genre. Lee Dong Wook's and Yoo Inna's suited so well with each other. Him being a cold grim reaper and her being a extroverted and fiesty chick nailed it. LDW's character growth and his newborn friendship with Euntak was too wholesome.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Well described and defined supporting roles: The Grim Reaper and Sunny are for me one of the most beautiful and touching supporting couples seen so far (154 k-dramas completed).

It has many flaws, but it's still a ton of fun. In particular, the music of the main theme stays with you forever and adds a special element to the show that I haven't noticed in any show since.Everyone has written about the unstoppable bromance between Gong Yoo's Kim Shin, the tormented god, and Lee Dong Wook's Grim Reaper. And if you watch any behind the scenes footage of the show, you can see why. They were just having the time of their lives working together. Unfortunately, there are a couple big  flaws that prevent this show from being close to perfect. For one thing, we learn very little about our brave heroine Eun Tak, which diminishes our stake in her story. We don't get to see much of her past or her thoughts about the state of her life or the relationships she has with friends or family. And now that I think about it, I can't name any character that we get to truly know in depth. A few well placed monologues would have been useful to this end. I wanted to know about each character's history and past struggles, and how they feel now. Second, the main villain in the show is pretty absent until the very end. There was so much potential around exploring the heart of the issues faced by Eun Tak and Kim Shin and how they are trying to protect each other and deal with their own issues, but it wasn't harnessed. One last thing I enjoyed was the filming in Quebec. I'm a Canadian and that was quite a surprising treat to behold!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Nowadays, when you talk about Kdramas, a humongous classic is always thrown into the conversation. Gobli, Guardian, whatever it may be called, this show has remained rent-free on so many people's heads for such a long amount o time that it makes you wonder. What is it really about?At a core level, Goblin is no better than your generic, corny, over-the-top Korean romance with all the blows and whistles, but with a few twists that really drive off an ever-lasting mystery.The mystery doesn't really stick up at the forefront, but it's ever-present and slowly, but surely, gets revealed as you also get more and more attached to the characters and start paying more attention to the non-romance plot line, which in my opinion is a very underrated aspect in this series that's not talked about enough.It also helps that the show is such a binge-able series, especially in portions, or as you may view as mini ""arcs"".

Okay so Goblin has been sitting on my to watch list for a long time. I just, I dunno. It never grabbed me. I finally took the plunge to watch it. I loved the acting and humor they had in the series. But to me, this wasn't the best KDrama I've seen. Story was good, but the first half was kinda boring minus all the funny bits of the Goblin, Reaper and ""Nephew"".I would recommend to watch, but I doubt it will be a KDrama I'll ever watch again.Good cast, great songs and good story line. But yet like i said, the first half was boring. I dunno why, but it was.Comment on this if you watch it from my review :) Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The cast... maan, was amaziiing. The acting and the soundtrack were completely wonderful, however the plot literally didn't exist. The story overall was cute, but most of the time nothing really happenned and was boring sometimes, this is why it took me about 4 months to finish.The Goblin's and Ji Eun Tak's death were almost completely pointless, or more of like tiring in my opinion. By that time I already could figure it out what is going to happen and how would the series end. Don't get me wrong, what I mean is, that i get why they had to die, but by the last two or three eps, I was literally just hoping that the series will end soon and I can close it down. The relationship between the Grim Reaper and Sunny, and how all the caracters had been connected to each other were amazing and gripping, but maaan. So much suffering and crying from my part, and all without any use.What I really did not like, is this open ending. And under open, I mean that it's great, that the Reaper and Sunny got a happy ending, but we've never got to know how many lives the Reaper has got left, and how is that that they didn't have their memories back.AND, I would just like to mention, that although it's really cute, that Special Case was  reborn, but she's still a human, and will die eventually. AND, how is that, that the Goblin managed to get back to life, and got back his powers and everything, but somehow nobody mentioned how will he die. Like... Will he just live till eternity, after Eun Tak dies the forth time??? Broo.. And ALSO, I really, really wanted all three(four mby) of them to meet again, but since the Reaper and Sunny has serious memory loss, although netiher of them drank that fcking tea, I think I must just let it go and leave it be.In the end, just to sum up, I would definetely recommend this kdrama, but let me just warn y'all, that it's not for the weak ones. xd  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

This was the first supernatural/fantasy genre Kdrama I saw so I was very sceptical but I LOVED it.The story was so captivating. The casting was perfection and all the cast members knew what they were doing.The back and forth between the modern timeline and ancient timeline was so well done.The highlight of the show for me was the bromance between the goblin and the grim reaper.The love story was between the goblin and the main FL was fine (once you get past the creepy age difference). I preferred the love story of the second ML and FL more.A good story makes or breaks the show for me but OST makes it unforgettable. This show has arguably one of the best OSTs.

But since it's not the case and kdrama since then have a better production so it's not the only high budget drama anymore, I'll say it really wasn't worth watching.The story didn't move at all, they spent so many episodes going back and forth, and they would go as much as 5 episodes without nothing substantial happening. The story could be condensed in a 1h30 movie, I'm not sure there was even a story worth telling to  begin with.The second leads helped me get through the show, their storyline was a little more interesting, but the second part of their story was a little boring to.The bromance was on point though.

The cast, acting, cinematography, dialogues, story line and music were top notch. The reason why this drama is celebrated by many is due to the uniqueness of each characters. The drama shows how much past trauma can hurt someone. Though the ML is a goblin he's suffering to find his bride and from his past guilt, though the FL is cheerful she has had an abusive past, and on the contrary the grim reaper suffers from not being able to recall his past. This goes to show that no matter what you've to bear the consequences of your past actions. What makes this drama extra special is its perfect blend of romance, grief, comedy and revenge. It's my comfort show that I've binged several times and would highly recommend to others too.

You cannot help to fall for them, I fully understand that!If you only want to swoon for the actors, just go on, they are great! But honestly, the ending isn't satisfying at all. It just feels as if the sad ending is only delayed for an unknown amount of time. And the religious beliefs in this story are a great mess. A very strange mix of catholic and buddhistic elements called fantasy. Come on, there are reincarnations AND heaven and hell at the same time, to mention just one example...

I'm not one to cry when watching dramas, or anything really, but I cried like a baby in this one. The actors are great, and you really get tangled up in the feelings the story is portraying. It's a heartbreaking, beautiful story  and I felt every second of it.The only downside for me was the way they wrapped up the last minutes of the drama. I hoped we would see at least some development, and that the friendship between the goblin and the grim reaper would get through the forgetting past aspect, just like the bride. Another aspect was how they ended the nephew role, it just kind of ended, and we never got any update on him, as he doesn't remember anything from the past. Little bummers, but not major.It is still a great drama and I definitely recommend it! Every second is worth it.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Anastasialovesdrama","/profile/kookie_luv5","May  8, 2021","0","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    This review may contain spoilers this drama destroyed me....  Goblin is a fantasy romance about a modern day goblin (Gong Yoo) who seeks to end his cursed immortal life and needs a human bride (Kim Go Eun) to do so.  His life then becomes intertwined with a grim reaper (Lee Dong Wook) who is unable to remember his past. But when the goblin finally finds his bride, he suddenly realizes he wants to live and be with her.Goblin is an epic tale with a story that spans centuries. It was quite an interesting ride filled with some amazing characters, talented actors, and a fresh and unique story woven beautifully throughout each episode. I really love seeing a kdrama with such a heavy fantasy concept. It creates a full mythology surrounding the characters and how certain things work. That makes discovering this world and its secrets very interesting. There are some very impressive shots in the opening episode featuring an intense battle during the historical portion and a huge ship caught in raging waters. The historical portion as a whole had a very cinematic quality to it that was also very gripping right from the start.Gong Yoo plays our cursed Goblin, Kim Shin. There are many different sides to Shin’s character, and Gong Yoo played them all perfectly. He’s a brave and fierce warrior in the historical portion where he finds himself at odds with the king.We then have our Goblin bride, Ji Eun Tak, played by Kim Go Eun. Kim Go Eun was very endearing as Eun Tak. She was bright, adorable, and full of life. Her youthful exuberance is like a ray of sunshine that warms up Shin’s heart. It’s easy to see why our Goblin falls hard for her.Lee Dong Wook is our Grim Reaper. I have a soft spot for Lee Dong Wook, and I absolutely loved his character. He has such a commanding presence that instills power and fear, yet he easily transitions to a sort of awkward and bumbling character.Yoo In Na was lovely as Sunny. She seems a bit bored with life, but things really liven up for her when the Grim Reaper shows up doing all of these things she finds strange and fascinating.Yook Sung Jae did well as Yoo Duk Hwa. His family has served the Goblin for 900 years. He’s immature and a bit spoiled, but he has a good heart. He was a nice addition to our Goblin family.The story is very rich, and I loved delving deep into it. The drama sets up the story very well with high stakes and plenty of questions. While it does take a while to get answers, once we continue deeper into the story, the drama just gets better and better.  The drama does include a lot of humor which is something I greatly appreciate, but it was also sort of a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I thought they spent a little too much time on basic character interactions without a whole lot of forward plot development in the first half of the drama. Ideally, I would have liked more of the meat of the story to be better dispersed throughout the drama.In the beginning, Shin and the Grim Reaper are mostly the deadpan style. Initially, that made it more difficult for me to warm up to them. But the more I saw of their interactions, the more comfortable I became and the more hilarious I found them to be. As the drama progresses and they grow more comfortable with each other, their humor also became more of the fun and goofy style that I like. And that produces some truly hilarious scenes!Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun were a really sweet and fun couple. Their relationship has such a strong importance right from the beginning. Eun Tak was able to warm up the lonely Shin’s heart, and he was able to provide her a family.Goblin is a unique drama in the kdrama landscape. Its rich fantasy story that intertwined everyone’s fates was done very eloquently. Each character is memorable and engaging and completely brought to life by all of the talented actors portraying them.It’s an epic story of love, friendship, and forgiveness that tugs at the heart. It’s a poignant and moving drama that definitely left a lasting impression. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Starting from the acting, story, romance drama and mesmerizing soundtrack...none a failure, all over the top. Okay, if you can't deal with a guy alive for more than 900 years, you're not into fairytales anyway ;-)The FL is may be one of the most lovable, cute and pretty of all times. I guess the director must have smiled along with her acting. I guess Kim Go Eun surpassed any expectations. Sometimes you'll just watch her talking without reading the subtitles and begin to smile for yourself. The ML fits well also. Beyond that the SML and SFL story and acting is perfect, too and of course the interaction between the SML and the ML is anything from positively weird to hilarious.Besides all the fun you really wonder if the script writer knew for how many litres of tears and pain she would be responsible :-) How can you do this to us !?The soundtrack will stick in your ears for days after you complete the drama and even the ending was on the good side compared to others.

I have so much to say but ill try my best to shorten it fr u guys , i'll try my best to avoid any spoiler ?. If you've seen the 5 stars and hv already gone to watch the show you did a great job , but if you're still here reading this review ill give you guys some 'more than satisfactory' points so tht u go and watch this master piece!?       First is the storyline ! Its unique and has its own plot twists... I love how each and every characters stories get together with each other forming a beautiful complete circle! The cinematography and directing is great! I love how chronologically they have arranged all the event's of the story , all the events fall in the exact place and time where they should be in both the past and the present storyline...! The dialogues were awesome , it had a great effect causing on the mood and emotional impact! I specially love how they sometimes tried to make the dialogues poetic for some of the characters lines wherever there was a heartfelt romantic or emotional scene!              The humor in this drama is super hilarious and sometimes savage ?! Love how they try to give us some good giggles during an emotional scene!      Now comes the characters and actors , I loved all of them so i'll give separate credits? :- Goblin/kim shin - the lonely and great god who's been alone all this time , saves and helps people a lotta times,waiting for his bride so tht she can remove the sword just so he could die and lift the immortality curse upon him since the last 900 years! If theres a problem , call him , he will be always there for you all you need to do is blow a candle?. He is loving, caring & a great warrior.Grim reaper - became a grim reaper bcz of the sins committed in his past life , now guiding the dead to the right way , this reaper is different than the ones you've seen before. He's cold , clumsy, cute and stupid!? but tht doesn't stop him from being a good person and being a really good friend!Ji eun tak - an orphan , life full of miseries until she knows shes the goblins bride ! Falls in love with the 'ajussi' ? . she has a really adorable ?smile! On a dark silent night , she comes bearing the stars in her hands singing songs of angels without wings?.Sunny - 'SHE IS PRETTY'?!!! She is the most straightforward yet cool , loving person you'll ever meet ! She deserves a lot more happiness!!!Duk hwa - one of my most fav character ??!!! A chaebol heir , handsome, goblins right hand , loves his end-room-uncle and goblin uncle,loves credit cards, silly yet smart, knows each secret from the age of 6 , will call NASA if the weather seems sus !? President kim - the TT dancer , trustworthy, obedient,adviser.      Things I loved the utmost - kim so hyun , kim min jae ,the chemistry between all the characters, hated the villain,suspense, the bromance , friendship, humor, ost !!!? overall enjoyed every bit of this show , highly recommend to anyone who has a good choice for dramas !!!!

At the beginning this drama was a lot more mystical than I expected, but I got used to it pretty quickly and it didn‘t take me long to get invested in the story. I guess it‘s fair to say that Goblin has a quite unique story that is very emotionally investing and made me both laugh and cry. This drama definitely has its fair share of laughs and funny moments, but also serious scenes and moments that made me tear up. I also loved the cast and their chemistry - especially the bromance between Kim Shin and the grim reaper never failed to make me smile. To be honest -  I had to get used to the thought of the age difference between the Goblin and Eun-tak, but their chemistry was still great. I don‘t think I even have to mention Sunny and the grim reaper. <3 This drama has a lot of really pretty shots and scenes in Canada and Korea and I also really enjoyed the OST. Would recommend!

With Kim Shin destined to be joined with Eun-Tak, the former is able to summon the Goblin every time she blows out a candle.Believing herself to be the Goblin’s bride, this 19 year old is whisked up on an unforgettable journey of love, heartache and laughter across 16 unforgettable episodes.With echoes of the past life bleeding through, the early episodes work to build up each of our main characters, who are joined by the mysterious Sunny who rounds out this quartet. There’s also a number of supporting players who lend their voice to this one too, including Duk-Hwa whose family have been indebted to the Goblin for years.There’s also a mystery deity in a red dress called “Birth Grandmother” too. Although the drama doesn’t explicitly tell us, Koreans will recognize her as Samshin, the Goddess of childbirth and life.The story  does sag a little around the midway point though, taking a little too long to get to the crux of the drama. There’s a lot of will they/won’t they surrounding Kim Shin’s fate but as this one moves into its third act, the pacing does get a lot better. It’s also during these middle portion of episodes that an abundance of flashbacks are used to pad out the run-time.However, the chemistry between the actors is absolutely off the charts so it’s easy to look past this. Whether it be the budding bromance between Kim Shin and the Grim Reaper, the doomed romance between Reaper and Sunny or even the romantic angle between Shin and Eun-Tak, every single relationship is given a decent amount of time to grow and evolve over the course of the show.There’s a lot of bittersweet moments leading up to the ending too, which will go down as one of the best finales of any Korean drama to date. No spoilers here of course but this one is worth persevering with during the slower chapters to reach this incredible conclusion. Be prepared to come with a pack of tissues though – this is one heartbreaking drama.In fact, heartbreak and humour both go hand in hand here, with Goblin managing to perfectly balance both its romantic and comedic elements. The best moment of comedy comes midway through the show, as Shin and the Grim Reaper walk with shopping while the main theme “Round and Round” plays in the background.

The storyline is gripping, emotional, exciting and mysterious - all at once. The male actors have also done an outstanding job and their emotions are worn on their sleeves masterfully.  That said, it is not perfect. The female lead with her childish and immature behaviour is frequently annoying. However, what is most difficult to digest is why there was a need to bride-match a high schooler who behaves like a 12-year-old with a man who is in his mid-30s and has lived for over 900 years. It is this dichotomy that somehow really becomes and stays a thorn in the viewing side.  Comments could be made regarding the skillfulness of the main actress, but perhaps this is fully a matter of personal opinion. And then there is the matter of the ending - what a letdown. To get our hopes up only to be so brutally disappointed in a manner that made little to no sense - it was a true storyline letdown. It is still a pleasurable must-watch for lovers of Korean series.

I just finished this and it’s going to take a couple of days to recover.  This was SOOOOO GOOD!!! It ranged from suspenseful to cheesy to funny to heartbreaking. Every character in the show was great. The bromance between the male leads was hilarious and I laughed so hard I cried. They played off of each other beautifully.  The Reaper’s  romance was adorable and heartbreaking. It seemed hopeless and yet I couldn’t stop cheering them on. Deok Hwa was  cute and entertaining. The sidekick ghosts were a riot. And the evil ghost was creepy as hell. They all did a fantastic job. The main romance was thrilling to watch as they worked to overcome endless challenges. I know a lot of people have issues with the age gap, but let’s be real. Dude is 930 years old.  No mortal woman is going to be close to that, ha. But they did handle it well, I think. There was a New Years kiss and a goodbye kiss when she was 20 (NOT a child). Without getting into spoilers, this show spans a LOT of time and there was no real physical interaction until she grew up more.  He knew he was supposed to die, so he tried to avoid getting attached. It’s not like he was creeping on a high school kid. There were a lot of extra things that tugged at the heart, like the old war couple being reunited in the reaper’s office. All those little side bits added a lot of depth to the show. Also, the music was incredible. This is definitely in my favorites and I’ll be watching it again at some point- but not for a while because.. wow. It was a lot and I’m kind of exhausted now.

Now, i was really expecting more from this drama, especially beacause all the hype it had, but it was kinda dissapointing to be honest. I was expecting so much more from the story because, c'mon the plot sounds very interesting. Throughout the show the plotline just falls flat, like if you're expecting for some plot points to be explained or make sense by the end of the show then you're gonna be in for some shit. The story had so much potential but by the end it just forgets entirely about it and starts relying completely in the characters and their relationships, and that's ok in some dramas but you're not expecting that here! Like some stuff that happens makes no sense and what happened to Deokhwa?? his story was inconclusive and he was so interesting, my favorite character. Also, yeah the relationship between the leads can be uncomfortable or a turn off to some people, specially when he treats her so much like a kid sometimes. Like i get it, she is but bro don't remind us that much if u want this to work for your audience ?.Overall i enjoyed the drama a lot but i gotta accept that it's very very far from perfect, and that's ok!

I totally recommend you to watch it.I did watching while the drama was still on going, plus without any subtitle cause I can't bear to wait even a day for another episode. And tbh I've watched it over and over again.Why I gave the story 9.5/10 is because I can't say that this kind of reincarnation is kinda happy ending or what, logically (I know I shouldn't talk about logic or something cause it's a fantasy but I have to) the Goblin (Gong Yoo) is ended up being an immortal and Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun) keep reincarnating and she only have 2 chances left in the last episode. It's painful to imagine that in the end the Goblin must live his life all alone if she has no chances left.Anyway, I'm still LOVING this drama. It's in my favorite drama list. The casts is BOOM (I love the bromance between Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook, awwww they're so cute), the osts are freaking good (I know all of the song, and even remember some exact scene where the song appeared in), the cinematography, the setting, the vibe, the staffs, I love them.

Rewatching is also a must since it helps better understanding of many scenes after knowing about all the plot twists and ending.GY and KGE performance is wonderful to behold. They make you believe they are a fated couple and they make viewers want Goblin and Goblin wife to be always together. LDW & YIN performance also very commendable and their 2nd couple status complements the lead pair beautifully. Lastly YSJ is a revelation. It was amazing watching him able to match the light and heavy scenes of his senior costars. Aside from the off-putting way of endorsement in some scenes, the drama is perfect.

"mika","/profile/mika0298","Aug 26, 2024","0","8.0","Overall 8.0    Story 8.0 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 10 Rewatch Value 7.0    just 8 years late...  After 8 years, I finally sat down to watch Goblin, one of the most popular k-dramas ever. Did it live up to the hype? did it fall flat? Down below I break down what I liked about the show and what I liked less.What I liked- Lee Dong Wook with his slutty trenchcoat and funny hat 10/10.- The show probably has the most recognizable soundtrack around. Hits different. - All of the friendships in the show, probably the best part of the show tbh. Specially the dynamic between the goblin & grim reaper. - I loved the character of Sunny, kinda obsessed. - Loved the themes of death, god, immortality etc. Genuinely interesting - The overall pacing is slow, but at least it's even which is the most important thing for me. What I couldn't wrap my head around- Ok, let's just get it over with and talk about the main romantic couple...it just didn't work for me at all.  I normally don't mind age gapes that much, however, the main female lead acts more like a 12 year old than a 19 year old. I like Kim Go eun as an actor and she does a good job here as well, but it's more about how the character is written. I don't get why they didn't just age her up? Go Eun was like 24-25 during filming, there was no reason for her to be 19. They could just have made her a university student and written her in a more mature way and the plot would still make sense. Because of this, the main couple just have 0 chemistry, they act more like very fond siblings. - Some of the editing and camerawork was a bit iffy at times, not a huge issue for me though.- The ending seemed a bit rushed.To be honest, this was a pretty difficult show for me to score, so I settled for an 8/10, even though I was planning on giving it a 7.5/10 first.  Goblin for me is a show with a lot of great aspects that do a lot of heavy lifting for the show, but also some critical downsides. I did enjoy this show overall and felt emotionally invested in the characters. Do I get why this is one of the most popular k-dramas ever? yeah I can see it. Is it one of the best k-dramas in terms of entertainment and quality? No, absolutely not. Does it live up to the hype for me? Unfortunately, I can't say that it does, but it's still a steller k-drama. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

"fangirlinph","/profile/fangirlinph","Jun 13, 2022","0","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 10 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.0    This review may contain spoilers Happiness is fleeting and yet we live   Story:  A goblin who accidentally made a goblin wife upon saving someone.  I love the plot. Fantasy wise, it makes sense and somehow convincing, however there were some irregularities when it comes to time and reasons. The tug-of-war of their emotions and dialogues were kind of strange and vague in episode 4 onwards, fortunately, their communication got better. It had a touch of enough flashback in which I kinda hope they didn't switch the face, the acting of the younger/goryeo version of the second couple were much better. First three episodes and last three episodes were the best, cinematography wise, OST wise and plot-wise. The rest had some draggy moments of the two couples with sprinkles of emotional and funny scenes from other casts and stories of random people.Acting: Eun-tak is indeed shining in this series. She acted very well as a strong-minded and hopeful girl despite her lost and abuse. She represented the character well, who thinks there's good in everything with occasional tantrums and sassiness. Despite the unconvincing dialogues with the goblin in their tug-of-war moments, the acting was appropriate and the music added to the mood. She did great in all her crying scenes. Kim Shin's acting was great too. Wang Yeo, i think, cried way too much after learning the past. His first cries were warranted but then it got over the top.  However, the bromance between him and the goblin were cute. Sunny looked great in modern, not so much in historical though. The rest of the casts were convincing enough, including the other Grim Reapers. Deok-hwa was such a cutie and Director Kim was memorable as well. Music: No complaints. Most of the songs were just perfect for the mood. Sometimes, I just listen to the song and not watch the slow-mo scenes.  OSTs are just amazing. Rewatch Value: I think some cute scenes are rewatchable but I enjoyed this drama because of the message, cinematography and music. Overall: If it weren't for the draggy parts, this could have been a perfect 10 drama, however, it had some inconsistencies and bad editing that I quite noticed. The time line didn't match as well. Correct me if i'm wrong, but I think Euntak's birthday(mentioned by the Goblin) is supposed to be in September and yet on the last episode, her birthday was mentioned in July? Apart from that, the time in between their first meeting, Christmas and the exams and part-timing were all over the place that it got me confused. Even so, I still enjoyed it as it did not affect my overall feeling for this drama.  Another is the ending, although I loved the summary of the second couple, I was quite concerned as to how it ended with Eun Tak. She didn't come back as a person and yet she was wearing her uniform? If someone has an explanation for that, feel free to comment. I just didn't get the essence of that ending. I imagined their ending would be accidentally meeting in the streets or something then the camera will mainly focus on their eyes and smiles upon recognition and bam, END. Anyway, the things I loved the most about this series are the message and emotions that come with it. I have watched a few reincarnation dramas but it never made me think about believing it but while watching this, it kind of made me believe it. Somehow, it can be true. Sometimes, we have that sudden feeling of closeness or goodness to a stranger. It's not because they have this gentle aura but because you just have that certain emotion with someone. The drama has more thought-provoking sentiments about life, faith(religion), fate/destiny, death(including suicide) and most importantly, love(in general). Romance isn't exactly the best thing in this, the main leads chemistry weren't great but mostly convincing for the drama. For me, It had a sibling-love vibe at first but it didn't give me that he's-too-old-for-her vibe as well. I think it's worth the hype, no matter how short their happiness is, they definitely made it worth it.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Much has been said about the undeniable chemistry between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun, but I would love to highlight the unmatched comedic trio of Gong Yoo, Lee Dong Wook, and Yook Sung Jae. Those three never missed a beat. Their character worked on having a unique bond and they it built overtime. In contrast, there is a soft and tender partnership between Kim Go Eun and Yoo In Na.The plot may have had some issues, but ultimately, it's the strength of the cast that carried this show. However brief their scenes might be, Kim Min Jae and Kim So Hyun also made an impression. The same can be said for Jung Hae In's guest role. I think it took care of its characters and how well they should blend with each other.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

So, if you are expecting an epic love story you aren't going to get it with these two. In reality, he is actually 12 years older than her, but that's still no excuse. I think that they were cast because they are magnificent actors that are really serious about their craft and this shows in their succinct and selective CV's. But they are so busy concentrating on their acting that they kind of forgot to be human! But I don't think there was much choice of actors at the time. They needed this level of acting to pull off the concept of the show. Gong Yoo is acting like he's bipolar. One minute he is the war-torn philosopical general from a bygone age the next he's a goofy kid. Kim Go-Eun, I just find this actress annoying...in everything.  Here she is just a 19 yrs old hyperactive schoolgirl and then convincingly a 29 yrs old woman ...I mean kudos for pulling it off, but still no...Basically, she's looking for a father figure and he behaves like one towards her. -Lee Dong-wook & Yoo In-na on the other hand do have chemistry and even went on to star in another series  'Touch Your Heart' based on this chemistry. Sadly, nothing I've seen them in after Goblin has been as good. It really did bring out their best performances and you can't imagine anyone else in their parts, but still they are doing better in their careers than the main leads. I think this show set the bar too high! The couple I ship is: -Gong Yoo & Lee Dong-wook who win the award for best chemistry in Gobin :) They must have had a great time filming it together. I love their witty repartee.- I have to give a special mention to Lee El, aka Red Halmoni, as she has also been in 2 of my favourite Kdramas:  'Black' & ' A Korean Odyssey'. Both made after 'Goblin' (talk about typecasting!) Anyway, she totally rocks in this! -There are quite a lot of similarities between 'Goblin' & 'A Korean Odyssey'.1. Both female leads can see ghosts.2. Both female leads end up being sacrificed in the end.3. Both female leads will only end up with the male lead through reincarnation.4. One of the leads gets amnesia towards the end, but this is just a plot device to recap and fall in love with their love story all over again. But, not to worry they usually recover their memories within 1 episode!-Another similarity I noticed was between 'My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho'  when Gu Mi-ho starts crying it rains. There is a direct link between supernatural beings & the weather, must be in the mythology somewhere. I find this really poetic.-Strangely, I get a 'Friends' vibe off the series. It is so knowing, like post-modern playing off the supernatural that makes it such a unique concept, which is not easily achieved. It also makes for such great comedy. There are so many funny scenes. that are just gems. Example: When main couple go to the cinema and goblin is terrified watching 'Train to Busan'  a film he starred in just before Goblin!-However the real star of the show isn't the actors, it is the hauntingly, instantly catchy OST. One of the best, if not the best I've ever heard. It really moved me and was utilised like an actor. Powerful stuff music!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Sometimes it was a little bit melodramatic - like a typical korean drama but overall I find it full of suprises that kept me watching and wanting more. Storylines were always finished and explained - for me it wasn not like they just threw something new unexpected. Each one of the characters had his own mission and drama did not forget that. (Spoiler) Kim Shin was so lonely and life did not matter to him but he found his reason to live. Grim Reaper wants to find out about his past life and he finds Sunny. Eun Tak had life full of trouble and sadness but then she finally find her home. She then sacrifices her own life but finds her way to Goblin. Sunny is just normal human being when she finds herself around abnormal beings. In the first half of episodes they are building the relationships so everything goes slower.Cast: They are great. I do not mind the age gap between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun because their chemistry is chef kiss. Bromace between Gong Yoo nad Lee Dong Woo is cute and funny. Yoo In Na is charming and all of them are building the atmosphere.OST: I love all songs.  Even if you do not want to watch this drama, please, just listen to soundtrack, you will love it. Unpopular opinion - I love Round And Round even if Heize sings it.What can I say in the end... The ending is bittersweet while Goblin will always see Eun Tak die and he will stay alone.

The balance of dark to light is perfect and didn't leave me depressed, even though it could have easily been the case.  The two main male characters were absolutely perfect and made the story for me. I would not classify this as a rom-com since it has very little actual romance. It's also not a comedy, in spite of it being funny a lot of the time. It is a great mixture of fantasy/comedy/drama/romance/philosophy.  The OST is so good I've also already downloaded it on Spotify.Like many stories of it's kind there are a few things that don't make perfect sense, or threads that weren't neatly (or at all) tied by the end of the story.

The two male leads are as charismatic as the female leads were lukewarm. As the drama went along, I was more interested in the love story between the secondary couple.

The directors were truly genius with the way they decided to film, cinematography in this drama held a lot of meaning behind it, sometimes it would take someone to look twice to notice.plot wise I must say it one of the most original things I have ever watched, the plot developed well and contained no visible holes that I could criticise, usually creators would fill those holes with unnecessary side plots or love triangles or underdeveloped characters, however, the plot of this drama is complete in every way. Just the right balance between reality and fantasy, a very thin line that not many dramas were able to hold onto very well. The plot stayed true to itself; when said thing is going to happen, it will happen. No shortcuts or exceptions just because the main characters where involved, that's what I like about this drama, it refused to stick to resolving the plot and dismissing main points just for fan satisfaction. All in all, the plot is incredibly thorough and captivating, heart wrenching but also somewhat warming.I think the thing that surprised me the most about this drama is how the characters are all so developed, no one is completely good, no one is completely bad and they all have their own struggles. I don't think there's a single watered down character or a character that did not suit the plot. They were all so attached to one another and that's something you rarely in see in dramas, usually it's the male character attached to the female character and the 2nd lead attached to the 2nd lead female. However, you get to see them all relying on one another, physically and emotionally attached to one another. The chemistry between the main male leads was invincible as well as the chemistry between the female leads, this drama truly showed that love was an umbrella to many different types i.e. brotherly love, platonic love, romantic, etc. Likewise, the romantic aspect of it was also very well thought, the chemistry between the actors felt so real I almost thought they were dating in real life.One of my favourite things about this drama is how realistic it is- as ironic as it sounds. They portrayed a 19 year old the way a 19 year old should be portrayed; hopeful, optimistic, immature, inexperienced. They portrayed a man that has lived 900 years the way you'd expect him to be portrayed. The pain of the characters was another realistic aspect, something that I felt through the screen. I don't usually cry at dramas, but this one made me feel things I haven't felt in a while- I mean I did cry for the entirety of the last 2 episodes and that sure does say something, I felt as though I was getting my heart ripped out, that's how lovable these characters are.All in all, a drama I'd watch a million times and never get bored of.Anyway, sorry for the long review and I hope you enjoy this drama just as much as I did! because i love this drama to bits!

The ending is definitely bittersweet, it's framed as a happy ending but when you really think about it you realise that the joy will be short-lived. One of my biggest pet peeves with fantasy shows is when they introduce a world that has certain rules and they don't stick to them for the sake fo a happy ending for the characters. l guarantee you that this drama is so well written that it doesn't break any of its rules even though you wish it did at times. It's in my top 10 ultimate dramas, l highly recommend   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

It hits the right blend of Korean-style mythology and modern Kdrama production. The story is excellent, although the latter half of the drama suffers a little bit from lack of time. For better or worse, this show is ""very Kim Eun Sook"" (the writer), meaning that it has a unique concept that relies heavily on your emotional feeling over worldbuilding, which definitely works for a romance-focused series. The OST is spectacular, and of note, Ailee's ""I Will Come to You Like the First Snow"" is still an emotional power ballad compared to other music in 2021.However, I have to agree with others who have commented that the main couple feels problematic -- their relationship feels like father-daughter a lot of the time, so it has an unfortunate feeling. This story doesn't work without being a romance, but I feel like it might have been better if the main couple relationship was an actual foster father-foster daughter relationship.But even if you have reservations about the main couple, it is worth it to overlook it and give this Kdrama a watch!

There are a lot of emotions put into their storyline which made me cry, over all it's good however I believe the idea they chose is hard to develop and maybe they should have made it more simple and less complicated. It's similar to ""tales of the nine tailed"" (HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS) --> you'll notice the same second main lead actor is there too. All they needed was to make the life for all the main leads less complicated, because I wanted an ending where they all-- something, since I don't wanna spoil this you'll find out while watching the ending...anyways, I won't spoil this any further, anyone who decides to watch it, all I'll say is that the ending isn't as expected due to their idea and theme of how the male lead would become. -Still recommended tho :))  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

A 900-year-old immortal goblin meets his “bride,” who is the poor, unlucky, abused-by-her-family young woman—a high school senior—fated to end his painful existence. (You have to just NOT think about the age difference.) While the idea of finally dying delights the goblin, things get complicated when the two leads...maybe don't want to be separated? This is essentially “Cinderella” in a more tragic and complicated form. The scenes filmed in Canada are gorgeous. Fantastic second lead couple and fun supporting characters all around. The goblin’s developing bromance with a Grim Reaper who is accidentally house-sharing with him is worth watching this alone—if handsomeness were currency, the two male leads could buy a country with their collective looks. Lovely quote: “When you’re coming home on a rainy night, what is it that becomes your umbrella? A voice that answers when you call. A memory of seeing the same thing at the same time. The first time you matched someone’s pace. Does someone come to mind? Yes, it’s that person. First love.”  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Unfortunately, it was not my cup of tea. I  gave up at around episode 6 and just read episode summaries for the rest so that I could finish the story without having to sit through any more of the episodes.The first episode was okay but for me personally, it was not very intriguing.  I wanted to drop it but, I had seen this site and so many people raved about it so I figured I had to power through because many people deem it to be ""one of the best dramas"". So I powered through for a couple more episodes but I just could not get invested in the show.  The episodes were quite slow and it felt like the story was taking forever to happen. Unfortunately for me, the ""bromance"" between the goblin and reaper was just not enjoyable for me. It just felt childish and cheesy to me. The romance of the leads did not sit well with me either.  For starters, the goblin literally looks like a 40-year-old to me (No offense main guy but that's just how I see you sorry). I did not enjoy the fact that he literally fell in love with a highschooler. The 900 something year age gap would not have mattered if they had a younger-looking actor but they did not. Additionally, KGE played this role too well and literally looked and acted like a 16-year-old to me. Don't get me wrong I love KGE normally. I just wished they had aged up the main girl character to be older, a college student at the very least.  Also, I don't know if it's just me but I think because I watched this drama, but KGE just always looks so young now. In her other works she just always looks like an 18-year-old  to me and its hard to believe that these roles have her in her late 20s (Not saying this as a bad or good thing I'm just simply stating it.) There were some things I did like though! I love the music and OSTs, they are wonderful and added so much emotion to these scenes. I still listen to the album occasionally these days. Stay with me and Beautiful are my favorites. I did like how they traveled, it was really pretty to see. Especially in Canada, the background looked great. I also really like the cover image of her leaning on his back, I'm not sure why but I just think it looks good. I really wanted to like this show but it is just not for me and I am ok with that. I respect that other people love it though as everyone's preferences are different. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"JanuaryWonder","/profile/JanuaryWonder","Feb  3, 2017","2","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 9.0 Acting/Cast 8.0 Music 8.0 Rewatch Value 6.5      Ah, Goblin. The drama with the most insane summary I'd read up to that point. Amnesiac Grim Reaper? Goblin with an invisible sword through his chest? Goblin's bride who is... a high school student, which is kinda creepy when you think about it? Ghosts? Deities? Reincarnation?   Yeap, all there. But damn, this was better than I ever could've expected. ""Every moment shined."" In deed. Ok, so maybe not *every* moment, but 89% of them for sure. I cried. I laughed. I wanted to group-hug the Goblin and the Grim Reaper and have a beer with them. They were friendship goals, level: immortals. Sometimes I actually wished there'd been more short arks with those two alone, because their interactions were both hilarious and heartwarming. The smartphone scene kills me every time, as does the one where they coolly go out of the tunnel with leeks and grocery bags. Bromance for the ages. Gong Yoo and Lee Dong-wook had the best chemistry out of all male actors I've seen so far. A+.  About the love stories.. though it was pretty hard for me to get with the program and support the Goblin and Eun-tak relationship at first because it was, frankly, wrong, to my great surprise (and maybe, a bit of disdain as well), I did like how they were written by the end and how their interactions were dealt with. I don't want to be hypocritical, I've enjoyed many a vampire romance in which the differences in terms of age were probably greater, but Gong Yoo was just so obviously older and the way they dressed him (op.ed. wonderfully) made him seem super serious. On the other hand, Eun-tak was.. a girl - this characterization is something I struggle with the most, because it both prevented me from rooting for them from the start, but was also a pretty realistic portrayal of the character, which I appreciated. By the time we got through the age gap though, I was totally on board. Well, a bit before that as well, just in time to bawl my eyes out to the rooftop scene. Her character really struck a chord with me in the end and I wish they'd done the jump a bit sooner and shuffled the stuff a bit so we could see more of older-Eun-tak's moments with Shin.  The story between the Reaper and Sunny was hilarious, I loved them together and I'm super happy that they got the ending they did, both of them. Eye-bawling moment #2. I especially loved Sunny's confidence which maybe made her come over as shallow at the start, but when you later realize how much she cares about him, and the history they share, it breaks your heart. The Grim Reaper was definitely my favorite character and that didn't change throughout the series. The deadpan comedic delivery, the whining, his brotherly love for Eun-tak and his ""clients""... some of the short scenes in the tea-room were my favorite parts of certain episodes, especially the one with the soldier and his sweetheart who was waiting for him for 70+ years.    Overall, the series was wonderfully imaginative, poetic, with beautiful photography and lovable characters. It did seem to drag at certain times, but never enough to even consider dropping it or putting it on hold. The fantasy world created in the show was rich and magical. Love, love, LOVE. A must-see.

If nothing else, you can be sure that there will be lots of roommate drama, bromance, and funny moments! Special mention to the scene where they go out to get groceries like the supernatural beings they are, it cracked me up. Why is this special, you ask : Go watch the drama :P  On a serious note, Goblin was like a ray of sunshine that flickers through on a cloudy day for me. Although it had its flaws (with respect to pacing and few unresolved questions), it was beautifully written and portrayed. The story was built with a rich mythology, filled with elements of hilarity, romance and above all melancholy. Each of the characters, even minor ones, had an intriguing charm to them and fulfilled a unique purpose in the storyline. Cinematography, especially scenes in Quebec, were visually stunning (I cant wait to visit Chateau Frontenac and other places in QC during fall now). I also really liked listening to the drama's OST, especially Beautiful by Crush, and have of course added it to my Kdrama playlist.  Maybe this might not be a popular opinion but I loved the bittersweet touch to its ending. I clearly have a thing for sad love stories. But what I took away from the drama the most, was that at the end of the day, we do need to deal with life on our own even with or without the presence of your loved ones. But, why should that mean, living life unhappily. In fact, live each moment with great joy, sharing precious moments with your dear ones, if not for anything else but to respect the love that you have received so far. With all the limitations we have as mortal beings, you might as well make the most of each moment. I was left with some questions at the end but I am ok ignoring these minor flaws as it kept me hooked till the last minute while also being thought provoking. Now, if only I could summon ""The One"", by blowing on a candle ;)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

At the beginning, i could see that this drama had some potentials to become a famouse one. And then, BOOM. Although this one aired on tv cabel only in Korea, this drama got so much attentions from KDrama lovers. It has highest drama rating on the tvN's history so far.   It was all smooth at the beginning, i really enjoyed it. I thought i would fall for the main leads' relationship, but nope. I fell for the bromance of the Goblin, grim reaper, and deok hwa bromance instead. They're absolutely entertaining and amazing together! Idk maybe it's just me, i don't feel satisfied with the ending. The ending is too contrived and too hasting for me. I was like .... ""Wait, what?"" ""What?"" ""Uhm okay"". But overall, i still like this anyway. Well, not as much as i love Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo since the story is more relatable, rational, and perfectly ended.   The soundtracks are amazing! Altough not all of them are my favourites, but i can say that the soundtracks sound very different with another Korean Dramas. It's, cool, creepy, gloomy, sad, and sometimes a little bit warm. Altough i love most of them, i couldn't say that the lyrics of them are easily to be remembered. I'm so proud of Sungjae's acting! He shows his acting skill just get better and better! And also, i feel so proud of Lee Dong Wook! Thanks to God he's shining brighter with this drama. Since, in my opinion, he had so many dramas before, but i guess not all of them are enjoyable for some kdrama lovers. Altough, i fall for him since his perfomance in ""Hotel King"". He was so hot in there, bruh! His wing tattoo on his back was my fav part of him to look at! LMAO. And his chemistry with Lee Da Hee felt so real!

At first it started off ok, but each episode was extremely slow-paced and the plot wasn't interesting. The main thing that I disliked about this drama was the relationship between the main leads. It felt really awkward watching there scenes. It doesn't make any sense of why a 19 year old highschool girl FELL IN LOVE with a 900 year old guy.  The age gap between the leads  in the show made it very . I literally had to search up the age difference between both actor/actress because of how uncomfortable their chemistry on-screen was. The relationship should have definitely be more of a Father/Daughter relationship rather than lovers.  I really dislike the main female lead, she really pissed me off. She got angry at the most random thing and she is really selfish. She claims she's the goblin's bride but then fight and argue with him. No hate to Jung Hae-in but his character was very unnecessary and was annoying. Some parts that I liked from this drama was the funny interactions between the reaper and Soni, it was really funny and there relationship is kind of of cute:) My favorite relationship is the bromance between the goblin and the reaper. They were so cute together and I mainly continued watching for their relationship. The way they comfort each other even when they bicker and help each other. The cutest scene was when they were both taking medicine because they felt ""sick"" and ""depressed"". I usually don't like to leave a show uncompleted but I really couldn't keep on watching, the episodes were long and provided us with barely anything and the plot was very empty. I tried really hard to keep watching but got bored of it every 10 minutes.  this drama is definitely overhyped but if you like age gap,  slow-paced dramas then you should definitely give it a try. I really did not want to drop this show, but it definitely did not live up to the hype it was given.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

The first episode started off good in the Joseon era explaining the background but after that it  gradually fizzled out. The main problem is that the 2 main leads have zero chemistry.  Because there is zero chemistry, their love story is not convincing.  As a result, her pulling out the sword loses much of its impact.  All the slow-motion camera work and love songs in world will not work if there is no chemistry.  Its not something that you can just manufacture.  Ironically, the second leads did have chemistry and I found myself looking forward to their scenes instead of the main couple.  As a matter of fact, I think they should have been the main leads and the main leads the second leads.

It's been 3 days since I finished watching it and I'm still thinking about it and feeling residual emotions.Gong Yoo as Kim Shin/Goblin was captivating. I loved every scene that he was in and the feeling that Gong Yoo brought to the character made the show for me. I was a little unsure about Ji Eun Tak at first since she acted so young but I feel like her character was everything Kim Shin needed. She matured quite a lot as the show went on as well as keeping some endearing childish qualities about her. So, although there is a lot of controversy surrounding her age, I think that it was fitting for how the show developed.The Grim Reaper was perfect, his awkwardness and dead-pan personality. The relationship between him and Kim Shin was one of the reasons l loved the show so much.I had so many emotions watching Goblin. I laughed and I cried and I loved the characters endlessly. A few episodes in the middle were slower than the rest, but it didn't phase me. I hadn't watched a fantasy drama before this one and I found I really loved the elements. I'm checking out more fantasy dramas as we speak.The music blew me away, I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The best songs, in my opinion, are round and round, beautiful, and I'm here, stay with me and heaven. If I listen to and I'm here there is a 99% chance I will start crying again.I felt the need to go back and rewatch it the moment I finished it, so it is no doubt a drama I will be watching again countless times.

From the minute I started the first episode to the end of this series.. it had hooked itself into my heart. The acting is some of the greatest I’ve seen, at times comedic but it shows the true character the actor is portraying.  I love the different roles that each character plays and the dream team duo. It is one I have prayed for another series since! This series had me laughing and crying all at the same time, it had me feeling all emotions. It was a rollercoaster ride for sure, one I’d gladly go on time and time again. I’ve even managed to convert over friends to K-Dramas with this series ❤️ Goblin stole my heart and will definitely never be returning it to me   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"ripplingseas","/profile/ripplingseas","Jul  7, 2018","1","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Well, this drama is undoubtedly a deserving hit in the area of kdramas. It's just that Kim Eun Sook is really one of the best screenwriters of kdramas, as she manages to create absolutely fulfilled and fresh stories, where even the secondary story-lines have their power. The only disadvantage of her works is that the last episodes become dragged and a bit too sweet but as it's something common in the dramas (the exception would be probably the best kdramas screenwriter Noh Hee Kyung, the author of That Winter the Wind Blows and It's OK, that's Love), I guess we should simply get used to it...However, Goblin is my favorite Kim Eun Sook's drama and there are a lot of reasons. Firstly, here we find a really strong mystical atmosphere and an interesting world with its own rules (I cannot appreciate the perfect musical choice witch makes you really submerge into the fictional world). Also the humor side here is one of the best in the Korean area. Another wonderful thing is, obviously, an incredible cast and the diversity of original characters. It's really nice to see such a charming character as Lee Dong Wook's Grim Reaper, the main lead is also very good, then Kim Go Eun, Yook Sung Jae...  And there are so many moments you can watch for a thousand of times and so few moments you prefer to skip... So, undoubtedly 10 ;)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

One of the best thing about it were the actors, especially the male lead and the second male lead, they were totally mesmerizing (No Homo), one could actually  feel their sorrow and grief.Another thing about this show were it's OSTs, each track perfectly fits with whatever situation was given, and that track that played during the goblin and reaper walk <3.Fav track from the show: Lasse Lindh - Hush/Stay With Me - Chanyeol & PunchThere's one thing I agree with those who bitch about it... that cringe, the age gap... Ig 19 and 39(By his looks) (938 if you consider his real age) isn't much of a difference in Pakistan xD. At sometimes he looked like her father, especially that moment when he pats her head. If compared with the second couple, I'd definitely choose the latter.Was Goblin: The Lonely and Great god good?.. yes. Was is it great?... definitely yesss.

"yviitree","/profile/yviitree","Jan 17, 2020","1","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 8.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 7.5    This review may contain spoilers   I wanted to give this a 10 after finishing it but now that I thought about it a bit I just couldn't. Goblin left me with so many weird feelings... the last couple of episodes are very emotional and it's just a bit too much to process right away. The fact that the show ends with the Goblin being immortal for real without any means to eventually die made me incredibly sad. Yeah, the girl gets reborn and finds him again and has four lives left...but what happens after that? Everyone else is either dead or alive without any memory of him - this thought left me absolutely depressed after finishing the last episode. There are also lots of other things that don't really get explained well or at all so that was pretty dissatisfying, too. What makes this show great is the beautiful cinematography, the great acting and awesome mix of drama, intensity, comedy, supernatural and historical and even philosophical elements and of course the bromance. However, the romance was kind of weird...at first there were a lot of fake 'I love yous' which somehow turned into real ones yet this process of falling in love is only comprehensible considering the Goblin because Eun Tak brings so much light and joy and variety into his so far loooooong and kind of dull immortal life, plus she's his destiny and only chance of finally dying (which is why it's even more sad that he had to become immortal for real in order to be with her again). From her point of view...well, he's tall and handsome and basically invincible, sweet and funny and oh, rich... however, there's no real visible or emotionally tangible development of her romantic feelings for him. The kissing scenes are cute but there is no real chemistry, however, things change after he comes back to life and she is 10 years older and obviously more mature. Up from that point the romance becomes tangible, realistic and beautiful and, sadly, also heartbreaking. It's too bad that that period is very short and Eun Tak actually returns to him as a high school student....As mentioned before, the bromance was amazing and I absolutely loved the dynamic between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper and the development of their friendship as well as the story of their shared fate. Deok Hwa (what happened to him in the end? I was a very frustrated that he kind of got left behind in the last couple of episodes) was also great and there were so many funny moments between those guys that lightened up the otherwise kind of heavy mood this drama mostly conveyed. As for the secondary couple Sunny and the Grim Reaper...I think their story was a much more relatable and deep love story but for some reason I did not really like Sunny as a character and also felt that there was no real chemistry between them which made their love story kind of a wasted potential.Overall, as for the acting, I really loved how the Goblin was portrayed although I found it strange how he behaved like a silly love-struck teenager when he began falling for Eun Tak but maybe that was to emphasize that it truly was his first love in over 900 years? I mostly loved how human and how  (emotionally) well connected to humanity the Goblin seemed despite being a sort of demi god. I'm not sure what exactly it is but he kind of gives off this calm and serene aura that just makes you feel comfortable just looking at him. The Grim Reaper was also great and became more lively and loveable with every episode despite his past mistakes. Looking at Eun Tak not as a part of the main couple but as a character by herself, I thought the acting was brilliant especially the difference between her bubbly high school personality (ok, it is debatable how realistic this is in her situation but it seems a typical thing in k-dramas that poor girls beaten by life remain cheerful and optimistic...), after the Goblin died and she became depressed and after he came back and she seemed way more mature and down to earth even in her 'bubbly moments'.Soooo, all in all, despite the huge plot holes, actually tragic ending and plain weird romance, this was still one of the best dramas I have ever watched because it made me become so extremely emotionally invested (seriously, I actually had to write this review in order to be able to process my emotions about this!). It's a bit sad that it stayed so much on the surface of philosophical aspects like the whole fate question, death/immortality, true worth of life in itself etc. because in the end, it makes kind of hard to summarize what Goblin was all about. But still, even this weird mix was great and very enjoyable to watch so I can recomment it without any doubts!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Don't let that cause you to miss on a truly amazing series with excellent acting from the cast, hard work from everyone clearly seen in every scene, and a story that  is well written.  Also with mature/seasoned (lol very funny bro moments/interactions) male leads! I only gave it a 9, story wise, because of the unfortunate and uncomfortable part of the age gap of the primary couple in the story - 18 going on 19 and 939 (30s-40s male in appearance).  The age gap makes it uncomfortable, but I won't give a horrible rating just because it makes me uncomfortable, especially when everyone worked hard to produce such a fantastic series. You see that, as you get to know the characters, there's nothing disturbing or corrupted going on between them. The lead characters Kim Shin (Gong Yoo/Gong Ji Cheol) & Ji Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun) are very respectful of each other, with adorable moments that make you fall in love with them. With this series, I'm pleased to see that although the secondary couple of the Grim Reaper/Kim Woo Bin/Adult Wang Yeo (Lee Dong Wook) & Sunny aka Kim Seon/Kim Sun (Yoo In Na) meet with tragedy, they are not forgotten. At the start of watching this I had to keep reminding myself I was still on episode 1 or 2 as the story got deeper, the characters more real/solid and the drama intensified. Be prepared to be taken on an emotional roller coaster where just as soon as you find yourself crying, you're laughing in the next moment. These actors are incredible! I was hoping there was a season 2 before the end of episode 1. It's so enjoyable, I didn't even realize each episode is 70+ mins long, which I'm grateful for because I just don't want it to end.  Also, did anyone see the goblin & reaper design on the pillows/rolled towels in episode 4? Nuggets like that make watching so fun. I'm in love <3  Also actors Kim Byung Chul (Park Joong Hun [Goryeo eunuch]) and Jo Woo Jin(Kim Do Young [Yoo Shin Woo's secretary] ) favor each other so much I thought there was one actor playing both roles!Episode 6 when Grim said I love you & Goblin's reaction as well as in episode 7 with the scary movie, those are unforgettable scenes lol Then Episode 11... man all of them!! I cried nearly every episode... The ending brought everything full circle, with all that wonderful, heart-wrenching, tear jerking, suspense filled moments coming to a cheesy but sweet end for the secondary couple and solid start for the primary couple. Though with the primary couple this, unfortunately, brought back the issue of the age gap. I was so happy to see them together but disappointed that the school girl with the a much older man concept came back. Why couldn't they have arranged for them to meet after she finished college? Also, it left us wondering about how things turned out for Yoo Deok Hwa (Yook Sung Jae).So try not to let the age gap cause you to miss out on a great series!

With the length of the episodes, the series could develop and redevelop relationships again and again in a way that felt natural--the best example being the Goblin and the Grim Reaper who move from enemies to begrudging roommates to friends.My only nitpick was that while most of the soundtrack was gorgeous and cinematic, there were a few songs that were pretty saccharine to the point that it was distracting.

It felt like that the Goblin came back too easily and literally every main character died at one point in the last few episodes. I wished the made the main girl a bit older.

There is a reason Goblin is ranked #2 in popularity on MDL….and here is why…..the development of all the characters and how they are weaved together……so so so so so unbelievably cool.STORY:Warning: The beginning of this show is really bloody….might be off putting if you are looking for a lighthearted tale. Goblin is many things but it is NOT FLUFFY NOR IS IT CUTE! The Goblin or Kim Shin is played to PERFECTION by Gong Yoo (yes….adding him to my oppa list). Kim Shin becomes a goblin after he is betrayed by the king and the people mourn his death. He waits for a goblin bride who can remove the magic sword and let him leave mortality…..nine hundred years later (and a lot of good deeds) he meets up with Ji Eun Tak (well done by Kim Go Eun) a graduating high school senior (and orphan), becomes room mates with a grim reaper (HOLY COW – Lee Dong Wook rocked it) and Deok Hwa (Yook Sung Jae…so funny), the latest member of a family who has taken care of the goblin for the last 900 years. Throw in a funny business owner named Sunny, a mother earth type god, and the big boss god who sometimes comes in the form of a butterfly, and well…..magic……just magic. Some have issues with the age gap between the ML & FL. I think the issue lies in the fact that she is graduating from high school when she meets the goblin and that is a bit much for a few folks. The show steers clear from becoming inappropriate. Perhaps it would have been easier for some if she had already graduated…..but I’m not quite convinced. (However, that weirdness does keep this from being a perfect 10 in my book.)CHARACTERS:I can’t say too much about these characters without spilling the beans with some spoilers.  Please know that I am just skimming the surface here.Kim Shin (Gong Yoo): All the broody goodness I love in my male leads and super hilarious to boot. Kim Shin will either make you laugh or cry or sigh, but you won’t be bored….however, just know that the grim reaper will do the EXACT SAME THING! Either way, Gong Yoo….I just can’t imaging ANYONE else playing this part……and the relationship between the grim reaper and the goblin….OUT OF THIS WORLD CRAZY GOOD!Ji Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun): Her character was all over the place and in a good way. Just when you thought she would be too miserable to deal with….she turns into someone funny, running circles around the goblin and the grim reaper. Her character could have been too sad and too depressing but Kim Go Eun keeps her hilarious and appealing for all 16 episodes.Sunny & Grim Reaper: Holy cow were these two characters the best in the entire world. Again, avoiding spoilers, I will only say: funny, scary, intense, sad, touching, sweet, heart-wrenching. WATCH THE SHOW JUST FOR THESE TWO!!!!MUSIC:I will admit that I am tempted to download the theme song because of the last couple of minutes of episode 2 (WASN’T THAT SO COOL!!!). The music was not repeated to the point of annoying and again…that main song….love it!REWATCH VALUE:Oh yeah….I could watch this over and over and over ESPECIALLY THE BROMANCE SCENES…..and there are lots and lots of YouTube videos showing them over and over because they are SOOOOOOOO AWESOME.Should you watch this? Um Yeah. If all my caps didn’t convince you then…….well, just saying. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Most definitely!I highly recommend it to everyone who likes a supernatural romance story, with a realistic development despite the supernatural. If you like also stuff like destiny and fate... Go for it!I do not talk much about the story or characters, because i do not want to spoil someone's own experience, impression and understanding of the characters.

The story is certainly intriguing in that it keeps you wondering how all the conundrums could ever be rectified; the story portrays a veritable railing agains the Gods if you will.  The characters are in a perpetual dance of  push and pull with fate and destiny, while watching  I always got the mental image of puppets dangling on strings pulled by a kind of sadistic puppet master; what makes the drama interesting is the gradual growth and self awareness of the characters which allows each one to make some decisions which do not appear to be orchestrated by the 'puppet master'.There is a strong sense of doing good deeds and being kind, especially with regard to goblin, and also with goblin's bride when she makes the ultimate sacrifice. I got the sense that this 'goodness' eventually positively impacted their destiny.I love the casting, especially with regard to the goblin, the grim reaper and Sunny. Whenever these three were on screen, together or individually, it was absolute magic! I'm sure I don't need to expound on the genius that is Gong Yoo, he has an uncanny ability to portray his characters so sympathetically, realistically and humanly; he imbued goblin with such pathos, simultaneously making goblin vulnerable, eternally sad yet strong and hopeful all at the same time, he is truly gifted as an actor.The grim reaper is an absolute revelation, Lee Dong Wook took this character to levels that I feel only he could take it, he seemed made for this role. His sadness is less hopeful than goblin's, he is always resigned to his unhappy fate, while being oblivious  at the same time because of his lack of memories. He is the character that shows the most emotional growth in the drama.Sunny has the appearance of someone without much depth, and yet she turns out to be very perceptive and emotionally intelligent. She seems to already have some knowledge deep down in her psyche even though she's not aware of it in the beginning. she is complex and many layered.Eun Tak portrays her youth in a cute, bubbly manner and she is a ray of light for the other characters. she does portray some maturity at the end of the drama but I'm never really convinced as I keep seeing the school girl in her.The story of the goblin and the goblin's bride is a beautiful concept, Gong Yoo plays his role to perfection but in my opinion the writing of the goblin's bride as a young girl really threw me off and I was never able to see the two of them as  a convincing romantic pairing. I kept wondering why the goblin's bride couldn't be the same age group as Sunny, writing her as a young girl didn't serve any dramatic purpose and actually took away from the feeling of intense fated love that they were supposed to portray.Sunny and the grim reaper on the other hand were very well matched, their trajectory was realistic, mature and deeply felt. The fact that their story was so slow in progressing actually added to the depth of their storyline and I found myself wishing they had more screen time.The goblin and the grim reaper had one of the best bromances I've seen in a long time, their interactions were entertaining, usually goofy and yet still managed to convey their growing strong bond of friendship in a very believable way. I really enjoyed seeing them together, especially when they teamed up to achieve a common goal.Special mention to Deok Hwa for his perfect comedic timing and refreshing 'irritating little brother vibe'So overall, I highly recommend this drama, it might seem to drag and go around in circles in some places, but it is definitely well worth the watch.PS: all the cast have a prodigious amount of beautiful coats!

What I did not like: I don’t want to put a spoiler here, but there is something about Korean Dramas that have a similar ending that I just cannot enjoy. I give all drama props for not using this textbook like ending, unfortunately this drama ended in such a way that makes me sigh with disappointment...but overall it was still a good watch.

From the story to the cinematography, characters to their relationships everything had this unique, exquisite, attractive feel to it.The characters were so well written, especially Ji Eun Tak/ Goblin's Bride (I know many people found her annoying but she is one of the best depicted mortal characters in here, I thought deeply about her character and she turns out to be the best out there)  and of course, Kim Shin. The OSTs were exceptional and soulful.  I literally know each and every soundtrack by heart. This drama might have been slow paced, I don't know for this was my first drama, but the entire time was dedicated to the development of the characters and their stories. The acting was extraordinary. The lead actors, along with supporting actors, were exceptional in portraying their role. I literally ship Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun and Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na (Even Yook Sungjae and his credit card!!) What I really loved in this drama was that the characters and their stories were interconnected for a relevant reason. The love stories were tragic yet beautiful. I personally adored Kim Shin and Eun Tak's chemistry and story and them. I was entranced by their story and chemistry. The story of Kim Sun and Wang Yeo was also sweet. The bromance between Kim Shin, Wang Yeo and Yoo Deok Hwa (mostly the former two) was exceptionally funny. This drama is perfect in its imperfections. The way it ended was the only way I know it could have ended. I expect myself re-watching it by the end of 2026 (I want it to be something special to me).  All I know is that I wouldn't have got interested in K-dramas if not for this. It was The Perfect K-drama for me. I hope you all shall try watching this drama without having any second thoughts (I doubted too if I should watch it but I nevertheless love it).  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Duckk","/profile/7691133","Mar 24, 2021","1","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    Just wow  I genuinely don’t know why it took me this long to finally watch Goblin, but I finally did, and hoo boy, was it one heck of a ride. Despite a very small number of supporting characters, this drama kept me engaged the whole time through its vibrant cast of main leads. Each character’s personality seemed to bring something new and interesting to the table, and I was at the edge of my seat the entire time because of the suspense that the main conflict created. I didn’t see too much of a problem between the characters’ ages, unlike some reviews, and while I did find it a tad awkward at first, I quickly adjusted and was able to support the characters’ romance despite the age gap. The complexity of the plot sadly left me a tad confused at times because of the abrupt editing that happens in some scenes, however the timed comments on viki helped me piece the plot together a bit easier, so I would definitely recommend you turn those on from time to time. I think it’s safe to say that I was crying during every episode once we got closer and closer to the finale, and I could remember having the absolute worst headache after finishing the drama because of how emotional and stressed I was getting. Some reviews warned of the less-than-happy ending, so I was terrified to find out what happened to the leads. To my surprise, the ending actually turned out to be quite happy (though some may perceive it as a tad bittersweet, which I do kind of agree with), though it wasn’t without its fair share of emotional rollercoasters. Overall, I believe the production of this drama was absolutely fantastic, and while I would love to rewatch it to experience the characters’ relationships one more time (the bromance and the sismance though!!! Ahhh, I”m in love!!!), however I don’t think my poor, poor heart can handle this for the second time. The OST was one of the best I have ever listened to (though I still believe nothing tops Mr. Sunshine’s OST) and I would for sure recommend anyone and everyone to watch this drama as soon as they can. It’s pretty much a classic at this point, and it for sure deserves to be called that! Happy watching, and please have some tissues and some Ibuprofen nearby (if you get headaches from crying your eyes out like me!).  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Aardvarkie","/profile/Aardvarkie","Feb 26, 2024","1","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10    Brilliant - well, I think so  It took me some time to get to watch this, despite reading rave reviews elsewhere, partly due to doubts about the story-line and concern about a snot-and-tears drama with a tragic ending, which I dislike, and partly due to access (cannot afford multiple streaming subscriptions). But a family member finally signed me onto Netflix (thanks, sis!) and the wait was definitely worthwhile. It's more difficult to review something when you have enjoyed it as thoroughly as I have, than just venting about bad or irritating things, but there are a couple of reasons I found this excellent other than the other positive reviewers whose views I endorse - it manages to successfully blend, comedy, romance, the supernatural, and thriller aspects into a cohesive whole, without it being jarring. You can watch it superficially if you want, or it can get you thinking on various topics such as how the world has changed over history and what it must feel like to experience such change, and whether it makes you feel that everything is just on repeat, or whether you still experience change as fresh and new. I like the way the 'not-normal-human' characters are fully-fledged people, with a range of emotions and growth during the series.  For example - to those dissing the Reaper's acting - I felt the reserve sat well with the character and the emotions he displayed were well-conveyed.  The way the ML and GR oscillate between staid old men and nervous teens was funny, illustrating how people can feel awkward and unsure of themselves no matter how old they are! I will definitely rewatch in the not too distant future.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

From Acting to OST loved everything.Goblin is lonely, depressed, blunt, ill-tempered. Loved Gong Yoo as Goblin. Nobody would've done it better than him. His acting was phenomenal. Ji Eun Tak is a bubbly, straightforward, strong, positive person. Despite her past, she turns out to be a happy-going girl, which is rare, because in most cases, girls who are bullied by their family always turn out to be a crybaby or timid. Kim Go Eun's acting was awesome. She played a bubby, fun-loving girl very easily.Grim Reaper is competitive, funny, poor at communication. I thought he would be a serious, no-nonsense kind of GR because most are like that, but his personality is totally opposite. Lee Dong Wook played Grim Riper mind-blowingly.Sunny is cool, sarcastic, beautiful, blunt. Liked Yoo In Na as Sunny.My favorites CP is hands down Goblin & Grim Reaper. Loved their bromance, silly fights.Things I liked :Goblin & Grim Reaper first meet & the way Goblin said a vulgar hat to Grim Reaper.Laughed when Yoo Deok Hwa said that Goblin isn’t that dashing.Love Goblin & Grim Reaper silly fight, their back & forth arguments.Goblin & Ji Eun Tak chemistry, the way she talks to him & straightforwardly asks if he is Goblin & she also wants to marry him.I laughed so much at the scene where the Grim Reaper was going to sleep & suddenly Goblin barged into his room to ask if the outfit was better. Because he wanted to look smart & perfect when Ji Eun Tak summoned him. He keeps on cat walking, disturbing him. Goblin changing Grim Reaper bedsheet into a flower print one.Grim Reaper sings Goblin’s underwear song to make him irritated. Their table fight, throwing stuff at each other.Loved the shot where Goblin & Grim Reaper both walked to save Ji Eun Tak & the song playing in the background.Goblin & Grim Reaper were talking telepathically & Goblin yelled at him to shut up, but Ji Eun Tak thought he yelled at her. Poor Goblin tried hard to explain to her.Goblin was jealous because Ji Eun Tak called Grim Reaper handsome & him ordinary.It is funny to watch Goblin doing magic to two strangers, a girl's hair tied with a man’s button, then she falls into his arms, things we see in K & C dramas.Ji Eun Tak bluntly saying 'I Love You' to Goblin & proposing to have children quickly. It’s funny when everyone in the restaurant, even Grim Reaper & Yoo Deok Hwa watches that drama with a lot of interest & Goblin being totally annoyed. I laughed so hard when Goblin's expression changed after he realized whom he was with last night.Grim Reaper expression when he starts seeing Sunny everywhere It’s sweet when ghosts help Ji Eun Tak with bullies.Goblin & Grim Reaper for the first time using a phone.Goblin is anticipating what Ji Eun Tak will do next & is happy because he is right.Love how, in between their argument, Goblin declares himself as Ji Eun Tak's  boyfriend.Loved the emotional talk between Goblin & Ji Eun Tak Ep 6..Laughed when both Ji Eun Tak & Grim Reaper say 'I Love You' to Goblin so that he doesn’t take their stuff back.It’s hilarious the way Goblin reacted in the movie theater after warning Ji Eun Tak not to embarrass him.Goblin getting jealous is so cute.I laughed my ass off when Ji Eun Tak friend thought Grim Reaper was her father.Sweet moment Goblin sleeping on the floor & Ji Eun Tak keeping him company.Loved scenery where Goblin back hug Ji Eun Tak. The background wasn’t anything awestrucking but the sky & sun shining on them. I loved the shotSweet & cute when Grim Reaper started to laugh wholeheartedly when Sunny started to sing.Ji Eun Tak calls Goblin her man & he repeated it. Poor Grim Reaper hearing everything.I find Grim Reaper & Sunny cute. Now I can't wait to watch Touch Your Heart.Goblin way of starting conversations with white egg & egg yolk.The Samshin Lady helps Ji Eun Tak every way possible.That brother-sister reunion between Kim Shin & Kim Sun.Goblin acts as a protective brother.Love how Ji Eun Tak was jealous of herself.I find Park Joong Hun's character irritating. I thought Ji Eun Tak would see the thing on Goblin at the end of the drama. In the end, they'll be confirmed that she is his bride, but it's good that she can see it within a few episodes. The ending Goblin & Park Joong Hun was fated. She was supposed to die but was saved by him. Became his bride to fulfill her destiny, to bring peace to his life. But he chose her over everything & fought his way back to her.Loved it. Lovedddddddddddddd the OST. Best OST. After Till the End of the Moon OST I finally found another OST which I'll be listening to on loop.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I didn't think I'd cry this much, but the first episode I was. I read a comment recently about a drama that left you emotional hungover and it said Goblin. I've heard it was one of the saddest dramas out there and they weren't lying.It's sad when you watch a character die, but it's worse when you're expecting them to die. The entire time watching this, I was like, ""I know, Kim Shin is going to have to die."" But the way he did made it the most painful. This drama is one of my favorites now, of all time. The quote, ""I heard we have four lives..."" Ugh. That gets me every time. To me there was some predictability to this, but I loved being able to guess what was gonna happen to both of them. And the ending. I thought it was going to end with him  dying, but what happened just made my life so much better. I loved this entire show and will rewatch this in the future. I need to go cry some more. I don't know who I am after this.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I'm so glad that I gave this drama a chance, it introduced me to some great new actors and reminded me why I love Gong Yoo so much, that man can act and his facial expressions are hilarious , when he cries you just  want to rock and hold him until he feels better.

Unfortunately, if you're exposed to a K-Drama of this high quality, you may feel let-down by some of the other K-Dramas that you come across, despite how good they may actually be.Let's be clear! While everyone has their favourite K-Dramas, that doesn't mean that you won't find others to be just as good, or very close, thereafter. Some K-Dramas just leap out from the screen and SCREAM high quality at your face. Some examples are:- Goblin: The Lonely and Beautiful God- Hotel Del Luna- The Scholar Who Walks The NightYes! These are head and shoulders above anything that came before them; however, even K-Dramas that rank 10th, or 20th behind them (in their respective years) are still far superior than the crap that gets churned out in Hollywood.With Goblin, you'll be enchanted by the actors (both lead and secondary); lulled in by the beauty of the musical scores (original music for most non-Koreans, for sure); and blown away at the originality of the stories. Keep in mind that Hollywood is struggling to find any original ideas; and even their television shows are essentially a remake, re-imagining, or blatant rip-off of something that has come before it. With K-Dramas, you might find that some were loosely based on Chinese, Japanese, or even Korean mythology, or historical fiction, it's done with a completely fresh mentality.I've watched Goblin a few times; and each time, I've discovered something new. It's so beautiful to watch the story unfold. You'll find yourself falling in love with the characters; and wishing that you would dive in and intervene. It's so easy to be drawn into the story by the quality of acting, as well as the production values, that you'll be hard-pressed not to be emotionally invested in every scene.Personally, I found myself falling in love with one character; wishing that I could help other characters; lusting for another character; loathing another character; pitying many characters; and generally feeling like so many other characters were my own personal friends and acquaintances. (That last is difficult for me to explain, further)If you don't come away from Goblin without first being taken on an emotional roller coaster, then you're either not human, or you K-Dramas just might not be your thing. If that's the case, don't give up right away. Maybe the other two series that I've mentioned above, will blow smoke up your skirt. Then again, maybe you just need to consider a different genre of K-Drama. Keep in mind that they truly run the gambit of genres: Romance; Supernatural; Comedy; Thriller; Mystery; etc... you're literally guaranteed to find something that you like.I'd like to add that regardless of the K-Drama genre, Korean directors/producers have discovered the formula for making average, or less than average looking actors/actresses look absolutely stunning... beautiful... cute... etc... Whatever it is, I like it. In fact, in retrospect, I've learned through K-Dramas that many of the girls from my past were more appealing to me than I realized at the time. (No! I'm not going to expound upon that. LOL! Suffice to say, as you get older, you get wiser... and hopefully, more realistic about life.)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"blackmariposa","/profile/blackmariposa","Dec 13, 2018","1","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Back in college, I got addicted in Korean/Taiwanese/Chinese TV series because of Meteor Garden. Then, I just stopped watching altogether because I focused on US TV series. When I asked my friends for recommendation when I got interested again in watching Korean TV series, this came highly recommended. If you are not fan historical settings/adaptations in a series, the first episode might discourage you which happened to me. After watching the first episode, it took me two days before watching the second episode and I got hooked ever since! I love the story line. Very refreshing and unique which attracted me most and kept me hooked all throughout. The cast were amazing! Even the supporting ones. Watch out for Sunny ????. She will steal your heart with her wit and charm! There are too many funny scenes which added spice to the show. And when tragedy hits, it really made me cry. It also made me think about afterlife and reincarnation. Although ending is expected, I still love how it turned out. Even the music were on the spot! I’ve downloaded the music/OST related to this show.Overall, if you want to deviate from the usual romcom plot, I highly recommend this series. It will keep you smiling and laughing. Dramatic part will hit you hard and were done tastefully. I love even the places where they shoot it especially the beach, buckwheat field and the tea house! I wouldn’t hesitate to watch it over and over again!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

It also helps that the cinematography was really beautiful, I absolutely loved it!ACTING/CASTING: well, I think one of the reasons why this show was a success was most def because of Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook, their bromance was more romantic than their female leads, and their dynamics was superb, not to mention the acting and the comedic scenes this two makes, hahha!MUSIC: one of the highlights of this show was their music - it was soooo on point- I have every song on my phone to listen to from time to time. It also shows that the music was effective because whenever I think of Sunny and Grimreaper the song that automatically plays on my mind was I Miss you by Soyou (this song was my favorite) or if the bride and the goblin it always was ( Beautiful Life or I will come to you like the first snow) that's how beautiful the OST of this drama is!REWATCH VALUE: I would def rewatch this show again just because I love the interaction between Lee Dong Wook and Gong Yoo hahahhahaOVERALL: this was a great watch indeed, I was just glad I waited weeks for this show to finish before I watched it because damn I would have pulled my hair out waiting for the damn episode every week!!!

Again, this drama touched one of those challenging taboos in society - a high school poor kid falling in love with a powerful rich man  way older than her. In any other circumstances, this point of view is highly controversial, but since this is a Goblin we are talking about, our moral values surrendered and went along with the story line.I love the lines on Gong Yoo's face. especially when he smiles - weathered line.... so majestically handsome.The OST is just so so amazing.

The premise about the curse and immortality was interesting. Unfortunately, up to about episode seven there wasn't much of a plot. The Goblin was an ancient being with centuries of life experience, but he acted pretty silly quite a lot. The Grim Reaper wasn't much better with his obsession about business cards. These characters should've been portrayed as more mysterious and dangerous. Instead, they often acted like dorks. The pacing was inconsistent. The plot tended to drag with prolonged angsty moments of reminiscing, crying, and filler scenes. Then, the story would suddenly pick up. The show should've been done in 12 episodes if all the filler was taken out.  The last few episodes were unnecessary. Since the villain was already defeated and the sword taken out, there was no longer a conflict that needed to be resolved so the story should've ended there.The romance was also kind of underwhelming. ML and FL acted more like a niece and an uncle. This was probably because the girl was barely an adult and still in high school. Only after the story went forward nine years did we see adult romantic chemistry with kissing, hugging, and acting like a couple. The villain and the final resolution was a bit anti-climactic. The flashbacks made him look more dangerous than he actually was, even though he looked pretty darn creepy. He appeared in the present timeline for just a few episodes with nefarious intentions to kill everyone, but didn't do much except threaten some people. Then FL pulled the sword out, ML killed the villain and disappeared. The end. I really expected there to either be a plot twist, a battle, tension, more struggle to defeat the final boss.The one thing the show excelled at was acting. Gong Yoo, Kim Go Eun and everyone else delivered really good performances. No complaints there.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Milahhxx","/profile/Milahhxx","Apr 13, 2018","1","10","Overall 10    Story 9.5 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 9.5      STORY: Story was BEAUTIFUL. Each scene either had me in fierce rage, crying like a child, giggling like a school girl or in absolute shock & in disbelief. It did not end the way i expected it to, but i still loved the ending even though it seemed like there were a few unanswered questions. At times i was confused (idk if this was due to my slowness), but soon the gaps were slowly filled. Each character had their own time to shine and i loved the short scenes that were given to minor characters to tell their own small stories of their struggles and hardships such as the one in the beginning of that little boy who was adopted into a European family. The first thing that got me hooked onto this drama was not only the concept and theme of it, but also the first episode, which i didn't expect to tear out my heart straight away and leave me with heartbreak. Although i would have liked their age gap to have been a bit smaller at first, i realized in due time that it would not have worked with the story line if it was. Therefore, it was okay for me. The whole plot was neither too rushed nor too slow for me. Everything was timed perfectly and the Goblin and the Goblin's bride's romance progressed well. Overall, i found the story and plot amazing! I took off 0.5 because towards the last couple of episodes, the Grim Reaper kept silently tearing/crying a little too much for my liking lol. (Yes, i know it's because of all the hardships he's struggled through, but still). ACTING/CAST: Nothing much needs to be said about their acting and cast. Everything about it was PERFECT....FLAWLESS! Each played out their characters extremely well and each of them are able to tug at your heartstrings with each of their crying scenes! Let's just say, i cried with them at a few of these scenes. Each character had beautiful chemistry; especially the chemistry between the Goblin and Ji Euk Tak. Gong Yoo (Goblin) is honestly so damn handsome and ahem...hot, and his smile is so adorable! And Lee Dong Wook (Grim reaper) is so beautiful he catches me off guard sometimes. Kim Go Eun (Ji Eun Tak) is such an adorable girl. I can't believe she's 26 when she looks like an actual high schooler. When she matured in the drama, she became so beautiful when all she did was change her hair and outfits, and a little bit of her makeup. Yoo In-na (Sunny) was beautiful to me from the beginning til the end! She looks so young for a 35yo too. Yook Sungjae (Deok Hwa) was hilarious and i loved how lost he looked half the time. I first knew him as a BTOB member so i know how weird and funny he is in reality. So his acting caught me off guard a few times since this is my first time seeing his acting and i noticed how amazing he really is, especially during those serious moments like the one in ep 12 when they were at a bar. MUSIC: In my opinion, Goblin had the best music and OST's. MY favorites were probably Crush's Beautiful, Ailee's I Will Go To You Like the First Snow, Sam Kim's Who Are You, and Chanyeol and Punch's Stay With Me. Each song was played at perfect moments which suited the scene. When you thought the scene was heartbreaking enough, the song that plays will make that heartbreak even worse. I didn't get sick of any of the OST's that played as i usually do with a few other dramas. So if you're a sucker for good, beautiful OST's, this drama is for you! REWATCH VALUE: Okay first off, i gave the rewatch value a 9.5 because i don't fully know if i would be able to  go through all that heartbreak again because i honestly almost couldn't take it at a few points. Other than that, i would've given it a 10. I would rewatch it for the funny moments and amazing plot, as well as for the romantic moments between the characters. OVERALL: I put off finishing the drama when i finished until ep 11, not because it wasn't good but because the story of the characters was going so well and everyone seemed so happy. And i knew it was going to go downhill from there and the past was going to catch up to them sooner or later.  This drama was absolutely flawless. It was hilarious and i LOVED the bromance relationship between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper! Loved their little antics. I regret putting this drama off for so long but i did not regret watching it and finishing it off in one day one bit. I knew this drama was an amazing drama because after i finished it, i no longer knew what to do with my life.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

The tone in the beginning was intriguing, the comedy/drama was well-balanced and fun, and the story was so engaging. But there was so much wasted potential. Shin's story was tragic and emotional, and I was deeply moved by his character, which is why I'm not rating lower. Yet the focus on the ""fated"" romance and the fact that it started when she was so young just bothered me. You can't tell me that these people were meant for each other just because they're fated; show me, let me feel their connection. I didn't, and that's where this fell flat for me.Story: All over the place. Too many interweaving character storylines and relationships fighting for center stage, too many repeating scenes, and truly atrocious pacing. I couldn't stand how slowly this moved, honestly. It felt like it started out strongly, but then characters would spend episodes doing nothing. They would talk, they would be cute, they would be unsure, but nothing really happened for so. Many. Episodes. And then when something finally did happen that brought the characters into conflict, it was too quick to feel at all developed. In particular, an antagonist popped up later in the series and when they dealt with them, I was left thinking, ""...that's it? That's how they're gonna do this?"" The characters were okay, but Eun Tak was just... not very well-developed, in my opinion. She's a bubbly, optimistic girl who can see ghosts and wants to help people. Okay, why? Why does she cling to Shin strongly at the beginning, and am I supposed to be charmed by the fact that an immature teenager is flirting with a 1,000 year old man? There wasn't much depth to her or their romance, and I felt disconnected from her character as a whole. Which further made the romance less engaging to me. Furthermore, so many of these characters had the potential to be amazing, with just a little more focus and development, which I think was sacrificed in order to fit so many of the other elements into the show.Acting: I do like the cast, especially Gong Yoo. I was also incredibly impressed with Lee Dong Wook as I've thought he was a bad actor in the past, yet his work here definitely made me second guess my opinion of him. Kim Go Eun is a really good actress, yet seeing her play an immature teenager for so much of the show really grated on my nerves. But, boy, can she cry. Both she and Gong Yoo can make your heart ache, I'll give them that. Never been a huge fan of Yoo In Na, but she did well here, so I didn't mind her.Music: Cute, fitting. I don't remember most of it, but I'm going to attribute that to the fact that I was consistently frustrated with the show. I can tell you that this is an OST that will definitely stay with the people who loved the show, though. TL;DR: I'm glad that this show has brought such joy to so many people, but it disappointed me. I should have known better considering how I've fared with Kim Eun Sook's other dramas, but I was hoping this one was different. However, if you like her other dramas and are a fan of fantasy, fated lovers, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of comedy, and a whole lot of romance, then definitely give this one a shot.

Before I started watching Goblin, the 'stir' of this drama was so big that coll, friends and media were all talking about it.I started watching Goblin with very high expectation but yet, it still surprised me and it just totally blew my mind .. The story is just so beautiful and too beautiful. The heart-aching part was so heart wrenching that I still have tears in my eyes after watching 3 times. I will skip the review on the acting as the acting is just PERFECT. Each character just fitted on the role perfectly. The comedy in the drama isn't a lot but the comedy contents are very new. How to say.. the comedy in this drama is more of cute and relax style. The comedy written in this drama wasn't found in other drama before. Everything just very ..... match.Goblin totally shake the world of drama a big time.

The bromance more than romance was total mindblaster with all those quick and witty situations i had my stomach ache laughing immensely.•This tale was perfect, for me its flawless. I always thought that for kdrama the lead shoud be handsome and beautiful, this drama broke my pretty boy syndrome. Gong Yoo outshined as dukkebi and i became a fan of him. His acting was just awesome. As for kim go eun, i had watched her in cheese in the trap where she played a university student was excellent but here as a high-schooler it left me with speechless. She looked like a high-schooler. I dont understand what kind of makeup the artist do that they actually give you a younger feel. Lee Dong Wook!!! Ouch he was real masterpiece. His eyes were more speakable, splendid acting and expression. And his chemistry with yoo in na was very nice.

Personally, Goblin was an amazing journey for me. When I watched the first episode, I felt like waking up from a sleep I didn't know I was in. To some, it is overrated. And, yes, maybe it is. But it's the kind of drama that you need to experience before dwelling into other genres. I felt a personal connection to all the characters and to the story itself. It has great production value and an amazing cast.STORYThe storyline of Goblin is simple, but throughout the episodes, you get to see different aspects of it. It branches out in a lot of ways, but stays the same until the end. Scenes from the past get repeated a bit too much, but I felt it was necessary because each time they brought some new emotions and even paralleled with scenes in the present time. Story of the past ties nicely with the present (and eventually future). The show doesn't leave you confused and, although it is in times predictable, leaves you wanting to know why certain things happened. ACTING/CASTA set of amazing actors who portray their characters so well that you will laugh with them, cry with them and even be agitated by the same things as they are. Gong Yoo is without a doubt perfect for this show as is Lee Dong Wook, Kim Go Eun and Yoo In Na. Others in supporting roles are great as well. All secondary characters actually have interesting backstories that go well with the main story.MUSICThe OST is simply amazing. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Each song is beautiful and appropriate for each scene. I find myself playing the OST on repeat a lot. Music is always a big part of shows and here it really emphasizes all the emotions. (Sometimes you hear a specific song and you just KNOW what's about to happen - you will either cry or die of laughter.)OVERALLI will most definitely rewatch Goblin. Tbh, it's my favorite drama of all time (probably because it's my first). Honestly, with the writing and the production value, it's no wonder Goblin is a fan favorite. It really touched me and opened my eyes to so many things. It often left me laughing and crying at the same time which no show so far has done for me. Definitely recommend to everyone, even though it might not be everyone's cup of tea. For me, it wasn't just a cup, it was a whole bowl of tea.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

When this drama ended, there was a sense of loss in me, to the point that I couldn't watch other drama for a while. This drama has made a deep impression on me, and I can't find any drama like this again, at least until I wrote this review. I love every episode in this drama. It's so good from the start to the end. The story goes really well. It seems that the writer knows where the story is going and consistently follows it. The next important part that also makes this drama memorable is the characters. They all left impression on me, even the extras. Every characters are just right, portray by the right actors too. The chemistry between the leads is one of the best i can find in kdrama.The production of this drama is also no joke. The production team really gave the best they could for this drama.

It made me laugh, cry and get so invested in the characters. I was that addicted to this drama that I looked forward to the new episodes every week and between them I would read all the recaps available online. :P   I really love the fantasy/supernatural themed dramas and thought this story was very unique featuring reincarnation, grim reapers, goblins, demigods etc it was very in depth. My only gripe and it is a very small one...is that I found the romance unsatisfying for me. Ji Un Tak seemed so young to me compared to Kim shin that I almost felt uncomfortable. Also Ji Un Tak seemed a bit immature even though she had so many hardships.   The bromance relationship definitely interested me more than the romance, Kim shim and the grim reaper just have such a fun relationship and are so similar it was great.

The characters, the music (my favourite is I Miss You and Round and Round) and the the plot was PHENOMENAL! I had a hard time not crying when the sad parts were on (not going to spoil) and had a hard time not smiling when they were happy. The ending was good, some people think it could've been better but I think it was sweet and everything was perfect!! My favourite was Kill Me Heal Me and Angry Mom but Goblin takes the lead!!  I will definitely rewatch this because I miss the characters so much, even after 15 minutes from seeing them lol. I recommend this to ANYONE who likes dramas as is is funny, romantic and have some action! It also teachers a lot of lessons and puts other people's lives into perspective.

My mother saw some clips from Goblin and really wanted to watch it; I remember some really great parts when attempting to watch Goblin the first time and so I decided to give it a second chance to see if maybe I would like it better now. Unfortunately, I still don't like Goblin, which really bums me out because I loved DOTS, which was written by the same person....It's not an issue of plot, it's more an issue with the main female protagonist for me. She comes across as an immature, whiny girl. I found her character completely annoying and entirely unrealistic when it comes to pairing her with a 700+ year old war general. It wasn't an issue of AGE for me, but rather, how her character was written. For example, in Cinderella and the Four Knights (a lovely watch, by the way), the main female protagonist is sweet, innocent, and overall, happy and good-natured. Even though both female characters in Cinderella and the Four Knights and Goblin had similar ""Cinderella"" circumstances, the writers executed their characterization very differently. Ultimately, while I recognize that the writer for Goblin was trying to get a happy, innocent girl despite her unfortunate circumstances, in comparison, I think Cinderella and the Four Knights female MC was so much better. She was someone I could respect, root-for, and empathize with - I just couldn't feel any of those things for the MC of Goblin. I really couldn't move past the female MC in Goblin because of her characteristics that I mentioned above. And it really sucks because I really liked the other aspects of this drama. The Goblin has such an interesting story and history. The Grim Reaper was entertaining to watch. The interactions between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper were HILARIOUS. I also really enjoy Gong Yoo's acting and he's extremely attractive, which is a plus! But I just couldn't get over the insta-love and unrealistic romance between the girl and the Goblin.Again, I'm really bummed and I really really REALLY had hoped that I would like this drama on the second try, but I guess it just wasn't in the cards.

Unlike other vampire/immortal concepts, Kim Shin looks 40, acts 40 and he has the power and wealth of someone who is 40. Meanwhile, Ji Eun Tak looks 17, acts 17 and she has no power or wealth at all to her name.The fact that Ji Eun Tak is world-weary due to a traumatic life, and Kim Shin is currently on a playful/mid-life crisis streak does not solve this fundamental problem. All the cinematography and production budget in the world couldn't solve this problem. I really liked the character of Wang Yeo (the grim reaper), and his scenes somewhat redeemed the show for me.  . . but not by enough. I grade on other criteria as well:Complex Themes - 3In fairness to the show, I didn't watch far enough to see any complex themes. But, in the first five episodes it is your typical vampire/immortal romance (except more highly morally problematic than normal). There were hints of complexity developing. Character Growth -3Not up to the point I watched.Nuanced Women -7Ji Eun Tak is competent in her wise beyond her years but still has bursts of childishness. (The burst of childishness did NOT help with the romance hinted aspects).Cinematography/Production Values - 10It's really really gorgeous, with lots of real life sets and large production values.

I'm amazed at how these Asian dramas are starting to get better and more unique every year, and Goblin is definitely a piece of gold in this big and wide range of Korean Dramas.  I have to start off with the storyline. I've always been quite a fan of mythical creatures, especially stories about Japanese deities and gods in anime. When I first saw that this story revolves around similar folklore beasts and spirits, I was swiftly drawn into it. It was quite a ride seeing the mythical creatures being portrayed by the amazing and super talented actors. I mean, the Goblin and the Grim Reaper's bromance speaks for itself. At first glance, I thought that the main couple, the Goblin and his bride, was kind of strange and unrelatable, but they made such a cute connection during the series. I've been familiar with Kim Go Eun's acting in Cheese In The Trap so it was quite a surprise seeing her act as a bubbly and fun character, unlike the other drama. However, my biggest appreciation of romance goes to the ultimate Grim Reaper and Sunny. Their screen time is so strong and made me quite anxious each and every episode... Their chemistry is unbelievable, they definitely need a separate series! *totally would watch* The OST was selected perfectly. Loved the little touch of incorporating classical and pop music. The breathtaking shots of the nature and Quebec made the visuals of this drama out of this world unforgettable! Not only does this drama combine polar genres like comedy, romance, history and tragedy into one harmonized series, but also it combines existential and every day problems with the perception of time. Never has a Korean Drama changed my views on death and love like Goblin. This is worth appearing onto national television it was that good! I'm gonna miss it, but it's also in a need of a re-watch sometime soon!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

If one gets down to analyze this drama, you will end up confusing yourself so just go with the flow. This is a perfect combination of a good story that is executed by great direction and brought to such good life thanks to these amazing actors. If anyone of these elements would go wrong, then you would have a mishmash of a drama. I cannot credit any single department for the success of this one but all in a whole. I cannot imagine anyone writing such a concept of a grim reaper and a goblin cohabiting with the potential goblin's bride! It’s too bizarre yet so beautifully executed. The concepts of divinity and reincarnation are so well explored in this. The actors are amazing in their respective roles. The interaction between the goblin and the grim reaper is just too hilarious. Each one of them brings their character to life with such conviction.

My favourite drama of all time, for sure! I cannot say when was the last time i saw a drama like this and fell in love with it from the beginning to the end, was so well done. The chemistry between the actors is always there, between all of them and kudos for the main couple, even tho the female lead is younger than her male lead co star and has less experience, she was sooo good at it, i mean she has such potential she can mesmerize you with just one look, her eyes spoke in every scene with such emotion it gave me chills. I loved it! The male lead is also fantastic, he has way more experience of course and many acting skills under his belt already but he still surprised me on how good and natural his acting is and he was so good with his younger female co star, they worked very well together. He is such a handsome cute bear :D i just wanted to hug him all the time and wished i was in her shoes XD (shame on me i know lol but i really couldn’t help it, i fell in love with him and her <3)The story itself develops at a nice pace, i have no complaints what so ever and the whole production and special effects were through the roof on this one as well, major skills there and a great investment on the directors and writters part, i as a viewer was both delighted and honored to be able to see it and enjoy this drama so much :)The characters grow as the story goes as well, it deals with a lot of issues between life and death, pain and betrayal but also has a kind and comic side to it, some funny and heart warming moments to balance the mood set through the story and it's really well done, as to not always be sad and heavy, nor is it too bubbly and happy all the time. A good and perfect balance between the 2. It's a love story, a very deep one no less but it ends up also being so much more at the end of the day. It pans out into so many branches and possibilities, as we see the characters lives get mixed up together, all the problems and obstacles that show up and mess up their peace of mind. I got hooked up with this drama from day one and i couldn’t stop myself from doing a marathon with all the episodes until i finished. I was just so drawn into the story and the main couple i couldn’t look away, i always wanted more, i wanted to know what was gonna happen next, with all of them. I laughed, i got second hand embarassment, i giggled like a crazy girl fangirling about something cute, i actually got excited to get a decent kiss and some real intimate demonstration for affection from the main couple, i was surprised and shocked with some revelations, all the joy and sadness, i cried my eyes out so bad for the whole thing, i felt the love and it warmed my heart deeply, it was really a roller coaster of emotions for me. When i ended watching it i was no longer the same person and i loved this drama for it. (Just a side note, i mean i know that they were portraying a big age difference between the main leads and they wanted to keep it pure and innocent until she “officially” was an adult in the story but c’mon, i’ve seen younger actors and people do way worse things on tv shows when they are playing love scenes - and i’m leaving the skinship out of this conversation ok?- but a good and normal passionate kiss wont kill or steal someones innocence for gods sake. What goes on in these peoples minds completely amazes me and not in a good way. I mean people in love they kiss, they hug, it's not like i’m asking them to get naked and have some more steamy moments but a bit more intimacy like all couples have. I guess another reason was also the judgement from the korean viewers, people often discriminate about these things and public demonstrations of affection as well. It gets me triggered a bit i mean, its just a kiss or a hug, if you want to show someone you love them, even in public, there shouldn’t be any judgement, its not like they are committing a crime for fricking sake. Geshhh people, you see worse things on the streets everyday and you don’t judge as much, go figure T_T I’ll stop ranting now, sorry XD)My heart was never the same after watching it. It raised way high my stakes on dramas to a whole new level and i’m afraid nothing coming after it can even begin to compare.I highly recomend it and to watch it a milion times over and over, until your heart and soul are both content XD Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

They were effective as it reminded me of events that happened. It also took me a couple of episodes to settle into the story properly but by the 7th/8th episode, I was definitely hooked. I''m glad that I didn't drop or put this kdrama on hold. The best episodes IMO are from episode 9 onwards. The story was really well put together. Even though I didn't really know much about how goblins and grim reapers work in this kdrama, I got to learn some things.. The bromance between the two male leads was great! HAha definitely one of the best in kdrama, no doubt. The acting was another outstanding aspect of this kdrama! Gong Yoo is such an amazing actor. I remember seeing my first work of his in Train to Busan. I always found him to be an amazing actor. Dong Wook was someone who could deliver a specific emotion just like that. He has such an expressive face. When he was sad, I was sad too. I was moved by his acting the most. Lead actresses  KGE and YIN played their parts exceptionally well as well. This whole kdrama was just ethereal. Finally, the music was SO BEAUTIFUL. I loved all the songs I heard. They played a great role in helping me feel the emotions as I, a viewer, should be feeling at particular scenes. If you don't want to watch this kdrama, at least give the OSTs a chance because they're absolute masterpieces. I would definitely rewatch this again one day when I have the time. I would probably skip some parts (like the fillers) but I'd definitely be in it for the funny scenes ^_^ BTW Sung Jae did well with his role. It bought some extra fun and ease to all those intense scenes. Overall, this kdrama is a 9.5 for me  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Ale-Alejandra","/profile/Ale-Alejandra","Apr 25, 2020","1","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 8.0 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.5    This review may contain spoilers   So, I had always heard this drama was a must once you started in the kdrama world and I finally this week I thought ok, why not? (I started watching kdramas in 2018, mind you) and as I was watching the first episodes, I saw people commenting oh this is my 4th or 7th time watching this drama and I thought you have watched the same show over and over that many times??? Well, now after finishing it in three days, and after crying buckets of tears, I can say that I understand why someone would watch this again. The acting is AMAZING. At first I thought it was going to be a very heavy drama so I was very surprised and happy by all the humour in it, the bromance between Goblin and the Grim Reaper it's amazing, I loved it so much.  The leads are great... I have my reserves because of the age gap, I like that they kept things innocent while she was young...... but still at times it was weird to watch, specially because of how young the actress would act, the skipping, the voice, and it kind of felt like he was acting like a father at times too. But despite that, I really felt some great chemistry between them.The music was incredible, the song used for the opening has been etched in my heart, seriously. The scenery and photography were lovely, stunning. I did find the story gripping, contrary to what I have read from some people here.... hence why I finished it in three days. i have to confess I am quite upset by the ending of the leads, I honestly felt that what happened in the second half of the final episode was not necessary......Someone here said it was basically like they started from scratch and I agree. Was the point to break the audience's hearts even more? To teach us a lesson? I don't know, I am honestly upset.... I really don't think it was necessary. You can tell I have just finished watching it and my tears have barely dried, lol. Would I watch it again? Most likely..... in a long time, though. It was a hell of a ride. Absolutely intense and emotional.  What did you guys think of it???   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I didn't expect the challenges they were presented with as they came. And this made me enjoy the show, wanting to know how each piece of information connected to another. I also like how they connected the present situation with the past of the Goblin.I also really enjoyed the relationships among the main cast. Aside from the Goblin and bride, I also like watching the interactions with Sunny, Grim Reaper and the nephew. The bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper was also really cute and nicely developed. One of the issues I had with the story was the relationship between the Goblin and his bride. It was difficult for me to accept a love story between a high school student and an immortal being who looked like he was in his late 30s. If I didn't focus on their supposed romance, I think their chemistry suited them well as a HS student and a 39 year old man.What I appreciated the most after re-watching it was that some of my questions answered (I didn't bother re-watching back in 2017) And I felt like I could accept the way the show ended when I didn't really like it before. I also have to say that re-watching this lost of the magic for me. It used to be one of my favorites, but it's not one of my top 5 anymore. Whether from re-watching it or because I found other dramas I liked better, I'm not so sure. I probably won't watch it again for a long time. If you're trying to decide whether or not to watch this, I still highly recommend it. If you enjoy shows with an interesting plot and good twists, interesting characters that also have their own stories (aside from the main) and don't mind the fantasy element, you should check this show out.

"Afra","/profile/alea","Jun 20, 2017","0","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Goblin is the very first KDrama I’ve ever watched and I’m so glad about it. Honestly, even now that I have watched a few more dramas, I still think that  Goblin is the best Drama ever.   First of all, the storyline is very unique and sweet. From the very first episode it pushes you to the edge of your seat and makes you feel with the characters. Although the episodes run up to 90 minutes, I never felt like they were trying to protract the story. In addition, the actors’ excellent performance make a major contribution to this circumstance. It is inevitable to not feel any emotional attachment to the characters. I can’t even count how often they made me laugh out loud or shed litres of tears.   The chemistry of the two couples is so intense, sweet and tragic that it even made my heart flutter. The Goblin and Eun Tak as well as Sunny and The Grim Reaper are just so sweet together. You can’t get enough of them. Besides that, the bromance of the Grim Reaper and the Goblin is just spectacularly hilarious. In my opinion, it is definitely one of the best parts of this Drama. I replayed their scenes just way too often.  All in all, Goblin is definitely a must see drama. If you haven’t watch it yet… what are you waiting for? You won’t regret it and I’m sure you will love it as much as I do. I can’t even express the emptiness I felt in my heart after finishing this show.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"cassey","/profile/callie","Feb  2, 2017","1","8.5","Overall 8.5    Story 8.5 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 10 Rewatch Value 8.5      If Goblin and I are in a facebook relationship, our status will say ""it's complicated"".  I had a lot of fun watching this fantasy world Kim Eun Sook created, and I looked forward to it every week, but felt it lacked the deep emotional hook kdramas are so good at. After the premiere, the pacing was meandering (to pull the sword or not fiasco), Eun Tak felt too needy, and I was unable to connect with Sunny due to her limited screen time.  But the cast was so endearing, it's Gong Yoo's first drama back in so long, his chemistry with Lee Dong Wook was so on point, Shin & Grim Reaper were adorkable beta heroes kdramaland don't always get, and I'm a sucker for fantasy about gods so I stuck on.   It might have started with getting entertained only through Shin's first love squeeing, but gradually per episode, I was feeling more for the OTP. Once Eun Tak admitted her neediness came from a place of fear of being alone, it's truly wondrous to watch her settle down and mature. I've grown to appreciate how good their relationship is, finally not keeping secrets from each other and just a great support system for one another. They chose to fight their destiny together, and not go all noble idiotic on me (or rather noble idiocy I can get behind on).  Once the show finally got over the first pulling of the sword out of the way, the pacing improved and slowly built up. When most of kdramas lose their way at the end, Goblin is part of that 1% that saved the best for last and went out with a bang, leaving me with all the feels and tears that makes it all worth it after all. Faults and all, I'll always treasure the drama for what it has done for the kdrama fantasy romance genre (which I'm craving more of). And like the rest of Goblin fandom, I know I'll forever feel a little bit blue when the rain falls.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

There is no story really to be honest. A grandpa who doesn't look like it falls for a high school girl but Twilight did it better. Perhaps because Pattinson. The casting here was questionable to say the least (apart from the side characters). Episode 1+2 were actually pretty good but then...boredom. 1. There is no chemistry between the leads (FULL STOP). Not to mention the cringy interaction between the overly childish behavior from the FL and the overly fatherly and awkward male lead. The age gap would not have been a problem had there been better acting involved. Actually the FL's approach to her character reminded me of the FL from When I Fly Towards You, only there the chemistry between the leads was 200% solid and the FL's  acting spot on. Why this casting here? Did the director order this approach? Just awkward.2. The bromance works, the side characters and their stories actually succeed in being more interesting than the main story. 3. I am angry because series that deserve first place got overshadowed on dramalist by this mediocre work. And it's not the works fault, they did their best, it's the reviewers fault who are not even trying to be more objective.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Vanished","/profile/Omodrama","Sep 20, 2017","1","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 9.5 Music 9.5 Rewatch Value 10      “Goblin: The Lonely and Great God” which aired from December 02, 2016 to January 21, 2017, stars a very wide range of actors and actresses in its cast lineup. From the Original Soundtrack to the cast, to the way this drama was filmed, I could tell that this was going to be a hit from the moment I sat down to watch it. From the very first 5 minutes of this drama, I was already hooked and ready to ride it out. I remember I watched the first 9 episodes in 1 night. An addicting and emotional story of the Goblin, his bride, his friend, his enemy, his sister, and his family is an amazing drama that I really enjoyed with all my heart.  The story, the tragic story at that, of Goblin, is really compelling. Kim Eun Sook is really a master storyteller. She writes characters and situations that make your heart skip a beat or even break. I found myself extremely emotionally invested in the love and friendship of the characters in this drama. However, I will be honest, I didn’t know if I actually liked our main female lead until about episode 11, I was on the fence about her, but in the end, I did really enjoy her. There were no characters that I thought were poorly written or not worth the emotional investment, I found each of them to be extremely well thought out and very realistic. Well, as realistic as you can get for a fantasy drama that is.  This drama had so much going for it. It was literally the most aesthetically pleasing drama I have ever watched. The cinematography, the lighting, the color correction, just everything was so beautiful. The way they made this drama look fit the fantasy aesthetic of the drama as well, everything seemed so dream and wonderland like. The original soundtrack for this drama did have me on the fence for a while as well. I was wondering if I really enjoyed the music for the drama or not, but in the end, I found myself humming and singing along to all the songs. They all fit the drama well and put a certain tone and mood to each scene which is what I always say I want. I love OSTs that can give me songs to sing later in life and that make the scene more impactful, and it gave me both.  The acting in this drama was fantastic for the most part, there was one part where I was iffy about it, but it was a really minor character crying so I will let that slide. Gong Yoo was fantastic, it is great to see him in another drama, not just movies, since BIG which was a total flop for me. I have always thought we were a great actor and that BIG was a bad choice on his part. Perhaps that is why he has strayed away from dramas for a few years, but I am glad to see him back in action. His sad smile and his eyes always filled with pain were really convincing and I hope I see him in more and more drama now that he is back in the drama game. It was my first time encountering Kim Go Eun, I know that her first drama was Cheese in the Trap which I know a lot of people loved, but I also heard the ending to the drama was pretty lame, so I have yet to go and see it. She is a young woman, my age (I’m trying to say I’m young at 26 lol). I did have questions about my liking for her character at times, but I thought she did a fantastic job either way. Lee Dong Wook never lets me down, he always brings his A game, and I was happy to see him again after my long drama hiatus. His character was possibly my favorite, I felt his pain and I loved the way his character developed throughout the entire drama itself. He was just great and there really isn’t more to say about that. Yoo In Na surprised me, I really liked her. The last drama I watched her in was You Who Came From The Stars which I actually don’t remember her in, so I don’t know what that says about her role. All I can remember is Queen In Hyun’s Man which I was really not that impressed with, so I’m kind of happy to be discovering her like she is fresh and new in my mind. Overall, the acting was just fantastic and everyone portrayed their characters well.  This drama was an emotional roller coaster. From laughs to tears within the same episode, this drama really had a way with playing with your emotions. You can get extremely invested in the characters of this drama and you hope and pray for a happy ending for them all, and I found myself truly infatuated with it. From the scenery to the story itself, and the music that will forever be ingrained in my mind, the drama was just plain old fantastic. This time, the hype train didn’t let me down, and I am proud of it for that. There is drama out there that are truly worth the hype. I would assume that everyone has already seen this drama. But, if you haven’t I hope that you will settle down for 16 episodes of pure fantasy, magic, and beauty that this drama has to offer. It is worth the watch and worth a re-watch while you are at it.

This is the first drama that makes me cry a lot, but also laugh a lot. It combines both dramatic and funny elements wonderfully.    Spoilers ahead:  The cast and acting were A+!! I was really happy to see Sungjae in a drama and I'm so happy he was such a great actor! I usually am a little skeptical when I see idol actors because I've seen some who weren't that good, but he was really great and I'm happy for him! Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook were exceptional! While I wasn't that impressed with Lee Dong Wook's acting in Hotel King, I found it to be exceptional in this drama and I feel like he improved a lot! His friendship with the goblin was hilarious and wonderful, I loved it! This is the first drama with Kim Go Eun I watch and she was great, I think she did a good job and I will surely watch other dramas in which she played! Before Goblin, I knew Gong Yoo from Coffee Prince and I can't say I had any opinion on him, but after this, I'm in love! His ability of conveying emotion is fantastic!  I know Yoo In Na from 'My Love From Another Star' and I couldn't really form an opinion on her, especially since I can't say I was impressed with her acting, but I really liked her in this drama! The subject was a new an interesting one for me, but I couldn't really understand why he was cursed even after she pulled the sword out and summoned him back. I would have expected him to age again, but idk. And if you think about the fact that he's cursed to lose her in all of her 4 lives and then never meet her again, it makes it even sadder! Overall, it was a wonderful drama and I wholeheartedly recommend it!

This show is also by tvN. It was beautiful, poignant, lyrical (to borrow Christina Bertani's descriptor), and all around wonderful. It stars the always amazing Gong Yoo (who I first loved in my first K-drama, Coffee Prince) as the Goblin cursed with immortality and Kim Go Eun (who did her television debut in 2016 in Cheese in the Trap) as the Goblin's Bride, who can see ghosts and is the only one who can break his curse. It also stars Lee Dong Wook (who, I will be perfectly honest, I feel in love with while watching him on the variety show Roommates and have loved in everything I've seen him in) who plays a Grim Reaper and his love interest is played by the very beautiful Yoo In Na (who I've seen in several shows and I'm very glad she finally gets to play a character who is not an utter bitch). There is no one on this planet who is as good at the wounded, kicked puppy look as Lee Dong Wook. You just want to hug him and carry him around in your pocket. I give this drama 5 out of 5 on DramaFever (where I watched it) and 10 out of 10 on MyDramaLIst. I'd give it 1000 out of 1000, even. The bromance between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper is amazing and would make this drama a joy to watch even if everything else in it sucked. Luckily, nothing in it sucks. Except maybe the age difference between the Goblin and his bride. But given how chaste k-drama romance is, I am easily able to give that a pass. :)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I'll talk about what was good about the drama first, then I'll talk about what I disliked about the drama.  Characters  The characters were all great, especially the two male leads. Their interactions with each other were especially entertaining. I can't say for sure that I really disliked any of the characters, though I think I liked the second leads better than the male leads. They were more entertaining and they made a little more sense than the main leads, which I will get back to later.  Actors  I loved every one of the actors. Usually there's an actor I hate, but not in this drama. They were all enjoyable to watch and they all did a splendid job.  Plot  The story was interesting, especially with the grim reaper stuff. In the end I kind of wish that the way life and death work in the show would work similarly in real life too. The plot always kept me interested throughout the show and there were a lot of cliff hangers. Stupid plot devices were used sparingly and they partially made sense.  Visuals  The cinematography was fantastic. Even if you don't like everything else about this show, you will just like looking at it. It is beautiful and a sight for sore eyes.  Music  I love the majority of the music in this show and I've listened to many of the songs multiple times. The soundtrack really stood out and I don't think I really disliked any of the songs.  What I Disliked  I felt absolutely no chemistry between the male leads, personally. I thought they made great friends, but I always grimaced at any romantic moments. I just couldn't see them together romantically. I see them as inseparable friends, but no more than that.  Also, the main male lead kind of irritated me. He's supposed to be like 800+ years old but he acts like a child. Also, you cannot tell me that he never fell in love with anyone until he met the main female lead. I think it is an excuse to blame his childlike behavior on his personality. In You Who Came from the Stars, the main male lead had lead a similarly long life like the main lead of Goblin, but he was not childish in any name of the word. I felt that his personality was far more realistic for someone that had lived for a long time. As a character the main lead of Goblin is great, but when you realize how long he's lived he just doesn't make sense.  Overall  Of course I recommend that you watch Goblin. Overall it was a really good show and there are plenty of reasons to watch it despite my negative comments at the end. Give it a try and you'll probably like it.

Goblins becomes the highest standard of my reviews on dramas I completed (mostly for Kdramas). What I learned from this drama: forgiveness (past events of Goblin/Grim Reaper/Sunny) and that there is timing for everything you encounter in life (Goblin waits for 900+ years for a 19 year old bride to show up in her first life)Tons of previous reviews posted already, so I will just point out what I like about this drama:Story: No boring scene, no skipping for me who likes skipping scenes. Side stories of dead people and ghosts are also meaningful and touching.Directing: Just perfect, won't say much, check out other Director Lee Eung Bok's cinematic workEditing: Details are woven perfectly, and all related. Pieces of flashback are not boring.Screenwriting: witty, deep, poetic. Follow Writer Kim Eun Sook for other high quality dramas.CGI: Battle, fight, and snow scenes of Goblin are epicLocation: Quebec Canada, can't have other perfect location than fall season with French touchMake up: Can transform one actor/actress to different roles. For examplem Kim Byung Chul as Emperor advisor, modern secretary, ghost, and cameo CEO.Costume: Classy and stylish. For example: 19 year old Eun Tak does not look poor and childish. Personality symbols thru costumes, for example Shamsin Lady's red dress, Sunny's bright colored clothing, and Eun Tak's red scarfCast: Perfect selection for every main roles and supporting casts are not bad either. Gong Yoo and Lee Dong Wook supernatural roles don't need to talk much but their facial expression shows deep communications. Kim Go Eun's natural beauty fits for 19 year old girl, Yoo In Na's cheerfulness matches Sunny lively personality.Acting: Lots of scenes with no dialogues just facial expression and physical movements speak louder than many dialoguesMusic: songs are created and picked perfectly support the popularity of the drama and songs themselvesRewatch: perfect, but I will wait for a while until I can spend a large portion of my time to watch it  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

And now I have to say I shouldn't have watch it. Not because it was bad but because I have a problem know. The drama results in a special interest in some of the Actors (especially one of them).   Story: After I have watched most of Kim Eunsooks dramas I was excited when Goblin was first announced. But then there was the casting. Although I liked the story from the beginning I didn't know If I should watch the drama. But then I read many positive about it and so I gave it a chance. The Story is about a goblin, but I was more interested in the story about the Grim Reaper. I love Grim Reapers. I don't know why but every time I think about fantasy stories, I think about the grim Reaper o.o.  Acting/Cast: When I heart of the Cast I wasn't very excited to watch Goblin. I will begin with Kim Goeun. I didn't know her very well, but I used to watch Cheese in the trap and dropped it after one episode, because of Kim Goeun. I don't know if it was her character or her acting, but I couldn't stand it. So her casting wasn't a reason for me to watch the drama. But in the End I have to admit that she is a very good actress. Her Character is one of those who grow from episode to episode. At first I didn't like her Euntak, but after a few episode I liked her. Kim Goeun plays the role very emotional and the role was sure very hard to play. But she made the best of it. The last drama of Gong Yoo I have watched was Big...And I dropped it after a few episodes. It wasn't because of him but because of the story and the female lead. But he wasn't so good, that I've watched it for him. The role of an over 900 year old goblin who is tired to live but has no other choice suits him very well. The big age gap between Kim Goeun and him doesn't annoy. He doesn't look like his age and his character who sometimes can be cute and childish is funny and gives fresh wind. Gong Yoo is a very great Actor and I hope his future roles will suit him as well as this one. Next up is Yoo Inna. I watched Queen Inhyun's Man and a little bit of One more Happy Ending. The first was very good, the latter was bad, so I dropped it. In Goblin she plays a Chicken restaurant owner. She remembered me a little bit of her role in Queen Inhyun's Man. Maybe I liked her role because of this so much. Her Scenes with Lee Dongwook were so intensive and the chemistry was the best. Her Acting is amazing in this drama, the most in the second half of the Drama. Now I come to my favourite character and Actor in the whole Drama. Lee Dongwook...I watched him first in one of my first K-Dramas (My Girl) where I liked him (but there was also Lee Junki v.v). Then there was Scent of a woman, where he broke my heart into pieces because his acting was perfect. After that drama I lost him out of my eyes. I began this drama because I wanted to see him again, but I thought he would be the second Lead. Kim Eunsook is wonderful. After Descendants of the Sun, a second time she spares us  with a second lead syndrome. Thank you so much! Lee Dongwook acts as a Grim Reaper who can't remember his past life. His Bromance with the Goblin is funny and excellent. The Chemistry between the two Actors is very very good. Lee Dongwooks acting skills in Goblin surpasses his skills in Scent of a Woman. I didn't know it would be poosible but the role of a Grim Reaper and his chemstry with Gong Yoo and of course Yoo Inna is amazing. I love this Oppa because he wakes up feelings. If he cries I want to cry, too. If he laughs, I want to laugh, too. But the most of the Time I wanted to give him a big hug.  Music: The Soundtrack is very good. I love the song Wish by Urban Zakapa the most. But Soyus OST is very good, too.  Rewatch value: Very high, but for now I want to watch Lee Dong wooks other dramas, I didn't watched.

I can't even express with my words how I feel about this drama. It has everything you could want, drama, romance, sorrow, happiness, plot twists, and so much more. The music was beautiful, it always fight perfectly with the scenes it was chosen for. I probably went though at leased 3 boxes of tissues from my happy and sad tears. If your not into historical dramas the only parts that are historical are at the beginning to set up the background of Kim Shin and etc. The cast all were perfect for their chosen parts. I found the acting superb. Personally my favorite character was the Grim Reaper. As you progress in the episodes you bond deeply with each character as their stories are laid out in front of you. Different obstacles arise for the characters and you get to see them get though it and it's dramatic all the way. The ending was well rounded and perfectly executed. It didn't leave me unsatisfied or confused at all. I only have good things to say about this drama and it will forever be my number one favorite. Highly recommend everyone to watch this because it, you won't regret it.  Thanks for reading my review this far, if you have! :)  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The actors/actresses  were all amazing, I mean you can just really feel the sadness, the distress, the sorrow and then the sweetness (that does not go overboard to childishness), the happiness, the camaraderie...  Add to this, this was a great comeback of Gong Yoo to drama land and when he had his sad moments in teh drama you just want to tell him to not be sad because his face just makes you ""aawww, don't be sad..."".

I'm here for Lee Dong Wook, and even then, I couldn't bear to watch through the series despite wanting to watch him! The storyline itself is quite nice, actually. I love the fantasy element of it all, except....The immature, childish, stubborn, reckless and irritating FL.  I'm afraid this is a very unhealthy and toxic portrayal on how a woman should behave! The fame of the show seems to agree that the FL needs to be ""saved"" all the time, that it's okay to be demanding and act cute towards a guy, because people think that's cute? But, it just further promotes behavior of woman having to act cute, pretend to be weak, and to be spoilt, just because they are female. My intolerance towards FL made me dropped the show. This means a lot, because I usually am very generous with rating. I easily give a rating of 8-10, in general. So, for me to give this rating means that's how underrated and disappointing this show isHaving said that, I really hope people still continue watching LDW, because he is an amazing actor! It's not his fault that the show turns out this way :P   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

BUT  So as everyone else i had enough of hearing about goblin even when it literally has been 6 years since it was made, and it's always either people HATE it or completely worship it! I was confused but i knew what to expectSo i watched it, put all those opinions behind my back and gave it my all attentionFirst of all let's just say that what i can remember the most and appreciated the most is kim go-eun acting and what made me laugh the most is Lee dong-wook and of course who i completely fell in love with was gong yoo, surprised? I don't think so!Yoo in-na was so refreshing, her character was the most shocking to me, i loved how she was bold and shy less which i wish we can see more of it in kdramas, she was everything the show needed to make it more fun and light hearted yet she was a huge part of the heartbreaking drama.The visual effects were as expected not good at all! But we could just turn eye on thatIs goblin a Masterpiece? No.Is it the closest kdrama of being a masterpiece? Yes.It's not perfect cuz it lacks so many things and at a point you'd feel like omg how is it that long? And the flashbacks are TOO MANY this to me was hands down the worst thing about this show! I just saw the scene you don't have to flashback to it like it happened 5 episodes ago??? The cinematography was dreamy like. I loved the winter feeling of it, at a point the show was just too much to take and the plot is already predictable so it really didn't need to be that long, i think the director really thought it was mysterious of like.. we were sitting blindly waiting to know what will happen!

If the writer just focused on the story of Kim Shin, Wang Yeo/Grim Reaper, and Sunny then it would have been meatier. I just find their story more engaging and ripe with conflict starting from 900 years in the storyline. But well, what's a KES drama without cheesy romance, right? Also, the chemistry between the cast (sorry, main leads not included - I just can't see/feel it) is superb! The bantering Goblin and GR, Deokhwa and his samchons, Sunny and GR, even Sunny and the Goblin. The overall concept and story are done well. I'm even invested in GR's tea house. I think that if GR has a drama of his own, focusing on the souls coming to his tea house, I'd watch it. From the few scenes we've seen, it was both heartwarming, funny, sad, and sometimes infuriating. Who could forget about the dog who waited for his/her pawrent so they can both go to the afterlife? It also touches on the concept of life and death and rebirth, how in life, we are presented with choices and it is us who ultimately chooses which to take. The angst between GR and the Goblin, and of course, GR and Sunny are well done as well. You understand each character and why they chose to do the things they did. At the end of the drama, I just can't help but feel something bittersweet about the Goblin. He made his choice and that entails being alone forever when the time comes that Eun Tak can't reincarnate. The drama just left a taste of sadness.I remember we were in Korea when this drama was airing. Everywhere we go, I hear the OST being played. It's one of the few dramas that I liked all OSTs. The songs really left a mark and it was used well in the drama. Even now when I hear Stay With Me, I still feel a little bit of sadness.It's not a perfect drama but it's good in all the right places.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

A goblin is like a god with extraordinary powers. I really expected that he would lose his powers at some point in the drama as this always happens in dramas with someone that has powers. But this drama didn’t do that. It was completely original throughout the drama and never followed the normal drama storylines that I get so tired of. I liked that there were no love triangles, no constant misunderstandings between the main leads, no repetitive makeup and breakups, no conniving family members, or any of the other typical issues that pop up in most dramas. This drama is completely original in everything which is what makes it so refreshing. It has a little bit of everything; romance, mystery, intrigue, fantasy, comedy,  sadness and happiness. The side characters are absolutely awesome and really add to the charm of the drama. It’s originality, amazing acting, and superb special effects make it stand out. I’ve watched hundreds of dramas including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese dramas. But this one remains in my top ten.  There’s really nothing bad to say about this drama.

It's got everything you could want and more. I'll admit that it isn't the most mature/serious show in some parts, however I think that's just how Gong Yoo works; he's just got a knack for that kind of character. I was seriously absorbed into this show, and I didn't even want to skip the parts with the secondary leads (Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na) because they were so good too, they all had such chemistry. The bromance was super fun to watch too. I just find myself coming back and then laughing or crying. IT IS SUPER SAD! You have been warned.

The directors were truly genius with the way they decided to film, cinematography in this drama held a lot of meaning behind it, sometimes it would take someone to look twice to notice.Plot wise I must say it one of the most original things I have ever watched, the plot developed well and contained no visible holes that I could criticise, usually creators would fill those holes with unnecessary side plots or love triangles or underdeveloped characters, however, the plot of this drama is complete in every way. Just the right balance between reality and fantasy, a very thin line that not many dramas were able to hold onto very well. The plot stayed true to itself; when said thing is going to happen, it will happen. No shortcuts or exceptions just because the main characters where involved, that's what I like about this drama, it refused to stick to resolving the plot and dismissing main points just for fan satisfaction. All in all, the plot is incredibly thorough and captivating, heart wrenching but also somewhat warming.I think the thing that surprised me the most about this drama is how the characters are all so developed, no one is completely good, no one is completely bad and they all have their own struggles. I don't think there's a single watered down character or a character that did not suit the plot. They were all so attached to one another and that's something you rarely in see in dramas, usually it's the male character attached to the female character and the 2nd lead attached to the 2nd lead female. However, you get to see them all relying on one another, physically and emotionally attached to one another. The chemistry between the main male leads was invincible as well as the chemistry between the female leads, this drama truly showed that love was an umbrella to many different types i.e. brotherly love, platonic love, romantic, etc. Likewise, the romantic aspect of it was also very well thought, the chemistry between the actors felt so real I almost thought they were dating in real life.

It delivered an outstanding and picture-perfect plot that will leave an unwavering impression on you in the end. The plot was the absolute star in the drama. It was so complex yet so brilliantly woven. And not all writers could do that. It was honestly, one of the best plot I've ever known. It delivered everything you would want from a well-written background story to the plot holes and cliffhangers, the unexpected plot twists, the intricate mixed emotions delivered in every scene, to  the moving romances.Gong Yoo paired up with Kim Go-eun was surprising and refreshing. It was a pairing we did not see coming but it was a perfect pairing for the drama. I was initially relecutant with the two as their huge age gap was evident in the beginning. But the drama and the story were able to ease up that awkward phase and soon faded away. It didn't matter anymore as the plot was just too good to even nitpick those very few flaws.I have high respects to the writer, Kim Eun-sook,for creating such an original, quintessential script. I fell in love with the story before I even realized it. And the way she carefully and cleverly weave the subplots to the main plot was a stroke of genius.And with strong leads, it would've been easy for the minor characters to fade into the background. But with the drama, everyone seemed to be the main character. Each character had a story to tell that is relevant to the entirety of the plot. Every one was charming and ultimately earned a place in my heart. For one, Lee Dong-wook's brilliant portrayal of Grim Reaper was hard to miss. He was first introduced with a villainous vibe but soon became a loving character that tugged our hearts in the most beautiful and tragic way. Even with a minor character such as Yook Sung-jae's Deok-hwa, he definitely delivered like a main character in the drama. He stood side-by-side with the bigger characters and earned his own spotlight. An artist cannot always be a good actor, but Sung-jae was an exception. The OST was also one of the best I've ever listened to. I was never into a drama's music, much less the entire soundtrack. But with Goblin, every song was a perfect hit. It was melodious, haunting, eerie, and beautiful. Overall, Goblin is a picture-perfect drama that definitely deserves a spot right next to the timeless classics. It was pure poetry painted exquisitely for everyone to indulge.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I finished watching it a few days ago and from the very first moment to the very last I knew that very few other dramas will be able to top what this one made me feel.If you're hesitant to start it please have faith and take the plunge. I can almost guarantee you won't be disappointed. The hype around it is well deserved. Everything from the intricate and complex storyline, to the breathtaking acting, the superb score, the setting, the beautiful cinematography interweave to tell a heart-aching story about fate, love that can transcend time, karma, the power to change one's own destiny and the strong bond of friendship. Everything in this drama is intentional and everything serves a purpose. Every scene helps set the tone of the overarching story and helps develop the characters in meaningful ways. You will find yourself holding your breath more than once!I will however warn that this drama is not for the weak of heart. The story is heavy with emotion and you will find yourself crying almost every episode. So if you are not looking for an emotionally heavy drama, this might not be for you. But in my opinion every tear is worth it. You will be sucked into a world that you will never want to get out of.Truly a masterpiece! I think I will be hard pressed to find another drama that can evoke the kind of feelings this one made me experience.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The Goblin's sadness is palpable and my heart ached for him; Eun Tak's innocence was charming, her wisdom surprising and the Grim Reaper was a sight for sore eyes. Sunny seemed to be one of those characters you look over and don't pay much attention, but she surprised me early on. The actors did an amazing job bringing to life these characters (either main or supporting ones) and they all shined through.The story itself was magnificent and compelling. It isn't as simple as it appears with its twists and turns. Until the final episode, you just are never sure about anything. I loved how I went from tears of sadness to tears of laughter and how balanced the sad/dramatic scenes are with the funny ones.The relationship between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper was perfectly developed. In fact, I can definitely say that there is concise development to every relationship in this show and it was a joy to watch. Be it the relationship between the Goblin and Eun Tak to the relationship between Eun Tak and her 'out of this world' friends.Overall, I can't recommend this enough. I dragged out the last couple of episodes because I did not want it to end and, even as I write this review, I am considering changing my evening plans to accommodate a rewatch of Goblin (sorry current shows...). I will end this review with one of my favorite quotes (hope this will entice you to watch Goblin!):“Mass isn’t proportional to volume.A girl as small as a violet, a girl who moves like a flower petal – is pulling me toward her with more force than her mass.Just then, like Newton’s apple, I rolled toward her without stopping until I fell on her with a thump.My heart keeps bouncing between the sky and the ground.It was my first love”   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I remember watching the first episode all the way back in 2016 when it was still on air and back then I wasn't really feeling it, adding it straight to my ""maybe I will finish it one day. MAYBE.."" list. that one day happens to be today and I can tell you that I'm honestly so glad I decided to give it another chance. the story was such an emotional rollercoaster, one minute I was laughing and the other I was about to cry but that's what made goblin so enjoyable to watch - it never got boring, from the beginning until the very end. there were some moments and scenes that I didn't particularly love and found a bit cringy but those were overnumbered by the high-quality ones that made it so worth to watch.  I had no choice but to give the cast 10/10 because the chemistry was simply great, be it the lead couple or the second lead. and, god, how could I not mention the goblin-reaper bromance, it was one of the reasons why I decided to watch it, after all, there's no wonder why I heard so much about it - I know I keep repeating myself but they were great. the OST fitted just right and always added the right mood to the story. I couldn't go for 10 stars tho because even though I loved like 99% of them there was this one song that really annoyed me haha. I'm not sure why. maybe because it was playing every time there was something shitty happening lol.this part does contain a spoiler but I just have to say it - as much as I enjoyed the story, in general, I felt the ending could have been much better. in the last episode, after the car accident happened they kept mentioning something about angels and I really really wanted eun tak to come back as one and live happily ever after. from the way they put it I didn't really understand what actually happened - was she human? did her mom die again? maybe it was explained there but I just didn't get it because I was too emotional and sad that it's ending however this is one of the things that really made me anxious and the reason why I'm not going to go all out and give it 10/10. I'm definitely sure that eventually I'm going to watch it again and I would recommend everyone to give it a shot. you can't go wrong with this - trust my words, it's worth it. now, this is not about goblin but I would like to mention that I just started watching  ""touch your heart"" where our familiar and beloved second lead couple is starring. I watched many things but it never happened to me to watch the same actors play a pair in two different dramas. and it's really weird to see them play roles so different from those I used to see them in. I'm loving it so far tho, hopefully, it's going to be just as awesome as goblin was.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"Daisuke","/profile/wildejamey","Jul 12, 2018","0","10","Overall 10    Story 9.5 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 10 Rewatch Value 7.0      After 6 episodes the attraction of this program imho is in inverse proportion to the volume of the romance scenes between Kim Shin and Kim Go Eun - and it seems to be increasing………ep 8 excellent, if a bit heavy - even kim go eun was good…..getting up to episode 13 I shared the consensus that this was a top-flight drama. I put off watching the final episodes 14 - 16 because I was reluctant for it to end. Now I've watched ep. 14 which is clearly sequel in nature. I have to say I found it a hard slog, the sparkle has gone, the interaction between Goblin, Grim Reaper and Deok Hwa sadly missing. If this continues I would have to say it was a mistake. They should have finished with ep.13 and maybe a brief ""follow up"" finish. Don't mean to be b*****, but the idea anyone or any supernatural entity would span the universe in eternal love to chase Kim Go Eun stretches credulity. Taking the plunge again at Ep. 14 better but I find the central romance utterly unconvincing, partly because it just goes on far too long - there's a limit to the sweet endearments and exchanges you want to hear. Finished at last! A suitably complex and, I'm glad to say, unpredictable ending. Ah, if only life - and death - were like that. Turned whimsical again at the end, but inevitable I expect. Isn't it wonderful also how time can pass in a camera shot in TV dramas? Preferred Grim Reaper and Sunny and Deok Hwa to Goblin and Eun Tak, though the latter did improve markedly towards the end when she stopped playing all ""kittenish"". Which reminds me, what happened to Deok Hwa amidst all the complex comings and goings at the end?? So annoying. The production values, background scenery and camera work were excellent throughout and the fashion sense fabulous - but when my mind keeps going off the story to the clothes and background scenery, annoyingly missing the subtitles, desperately waiting for the next scene with Grim Reaper and/or Deok Hwa, it's clear that it's not entirely absorbing my admittedly volatile brain. Music almost entirely good. Re-watch value? well not any time soon, but the fashion, design and memory of the comic parts may tempt me. Still, there's nothing else for it, but to give it 10/10 for the overall achievement. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I am very hooked with this amazing story with good and sad moments after continue watching it The story is very well written; however, I noticed some moments doesn’t make sense to me. Despite these moments, I still go into it with high expectations. I want to learn more about the mystery of these characters. The cons only are age gap and the ending. I am not talking about the age of these people. It is their characters/roles. The ending is little cheesy, but I think that is not bad. I like the bromance moments between Goblin and Reaper. The actors and actresses have a good job at controlling emotions.Overall, it is best South Korea TV show ever I’ve seen so far. The best part is the cinematography, and the songs are perfect.

I kept this one off for awhile, I started getting into KDramas about a year ago and I've been a huge fan of tear jerker/romantic dramas. I've said it before and I have no hiccups in saying it again, ""Koreans have mastered the art of tragic dramas."" I've seen quite a few kdramas and you best believe I've shed a tear or two in some of them, not embarassed to share that at all. What can I say? I can't say I stumbled upon this kdrama because I've always seen it mentioned everywhere, on the kdrama subreddit that I lurk quite frequently, in kdrama related discords etc..but people mainly talk about it for its beautiful OSTs and I'm here to tell you that, it's a god damn masterpiece, the OST's aren't overrated or unnecessarily bragged about. Each and every OST in this show is a spot on 10/10 - I genuinely can't find a single flaw in it. In fact, it just completes this show. Moving to the cast, you really can't get better chemistry between a male and female lead than this adding to the fact that the secondary m lead and f lead is also a perfect match! No matter what word I choose to describe the level of performance the artists have given, it would be an understatement. Coming to the show itself without spoiling too much, damn this director for continuously having a grip on your heart through the last few episodes. So very well executed, I want to hate it and love it at the same time but I can say this, it's definitely left a mark on me. Definitely going to have a Goblin hangover that's going to last for quite awhile. If you've read this far, give it a watch. Don't leave it for another day. P.S - The only reason I've given a 8/10 for rewatch value is because I don't really rewatch any kdrama cause my heart wouldn't be able to endure that much damage. It's a precaution I take for my own well being.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Anyhow! I loved watching this drama. The characters were so genuine, sincere, and wholesome. I'm a huge fan of Lee DongWook as well as Yoo In Na :) The OST is absolutely amazing I'm pretty sure everyone who hasn't watched this drama have heard of ""Beautiful"" by Crush at least once before. The cinematography never fails to keep me in awe. The panning and perfectly well filmed shots are so captivating and makes the whole drama aesthetic and beautiful. The plot goes a little fast at times and they don't explain certain things but the acting and casting covers up for the small flaws. I highly suggest this drama and to those who are hesitating to watch, I'm telling you: watch. this. drama. now. Also, I'm pretty sure you already know that this drama isn't exactly your typical romcom romance drama. It's pretty darn sad. I cry at least three times in one episode so prepare some tissues.

"Mandible","/profile/Mandible","Feb 11, 2019","0","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 9.0 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 9.5 Rewatch Value 8.0      -StoryThe story is by far one of the most unique and amazing! The way the director makes the romance/supernatural genre work and unfold  is different and introduces many interesting ideas. The pacing of the story is set at a great pace to where every episode keeps you fully engaged and has something truly important to add to the puzzle piece of the story. Not to mention, the cinematography!! The shots, angles, lighting, and location all combined make the show mesmerizing and pleasing to view! Cannot emphasize how aesthetically pleasing this show is! You are also taken on a rollercoaster of emotions from one end of the spectrum to the other end, beginning from the 1st to the last episode, so be ready! I don't wanna say too much here! The characteristic of the story that stood out the most to me was the character development. How the main characters are developed are nearly perfect. The story continuously reminds you of each characters values and their personal struggles to really emphasize each character's morals, motivations, and feelings. Because of this emphasis, you are able to gain a deep understanding of where the characters are coming from. Another thing I enjoyed about this story is the distinct persepctives it has to offer about the meaning of life and a higher being. It makes you question the bigger picture of life and the paths that life can direct you. The only thing I disliked about the story was the age of characfer, Ji Eun Tak. I felt that, that age was a bit too young and made me feel somewhat uncomfortable watching the show. It kept me questioning myself if i could continue watching this show (which i'm glad I did), but i could understand why the director chose that age. -Actors/ActressesI really enjoyed the actors and actresses they chose! Everyone played their script incredibly and did an outstanding job in displaying emotion, body language, etc. , but i have to say that Lee Dong-wook's acting stood out to me the most! -MusicThe music in this show is definitely one of the top! The soundtracks are super catchy and fit perfectly into this show. The timing of each soundtrack is beautifully placed in the show, bringing out so much more emotion in the scenes; especially in the scenes where it really matters! There were only a few songs I disliked but If i were to highlight a few songs, i'd say ""Beautiful"", ""Hush"", ""I Miss You"", and ""Heaven"". -Rewatch ValueThe only reason why I placed the rewatch value at an 8 is more of personal thing. For me, once I find out the entire story, I won't be suprised as much anymore, meaning the emotions and connections are not as strong as when I first saw the show. But there still is value in re-watching because there is so much content (as in most kdramas). You might be able o catch a lot of subtle things you might've missed, pick up on a new life lessons, and/or simply re-live the emotional moments! But would I still re-watch the show? Definitely! So, overall, I give this show a 9/10!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Only thing that bothered me was the story-line of the Grim reaper and Sunny, it felt really stretched out and I know they had a connection because of their past lives but we didn't see them actually getting to know each other in their current one, and the fact they kept breaking up and getting back together seemed redundant.

The soundtrack, editing, production values, costumes, food and locations are all top notch. This is quality all around, and done very well.The 2 male leads have a genuine bromance going on, loads of chemistry, so much a viewer could feel it. These 2 were hilarious and look very different. The Goblin looks like the cute guy from next door but the Gong Yoo's charisma is so OFF the charts, it's virtually IMPOSSIBLE to not like him and thus the character he plays. You can't buy that. He has it.    Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper is classically handsome with sexy bedroom eyes. He literally smolders while exuding tall, handsome and mysterious vibes. Irresistible really. With this amount of eye candy and camaraderie, what's not to love? As a bonus, both these actors make every item of clothing they wear look appealing, sleek, chic AND sexy. From long, tailored coats and beautiful knit sweaters to perfectly ironed pants, I don't think I've ever seen a drama where I NOTICED the cut and quality of clothes on the main actors because I felt they enhanced the look / feel of the clothes. Just gorgeous. These 2 could easily make a living as male models, I bet they could even make a sack look expensive and sexy. Mmmm. The female leads clothes were nice. and I have to give kudos to Yoo In Na who plays Sunny for making her square platform high heels look sexy as work shoes (impractical in real life but hey those shoes looked great). All in all the fashion in this show is top notch, kudos to the stylist. The story actually played out very well. I could have used way less flashbacks but it was okay. The soundtrack melds seamlessly with the scenes they are used in. The songs are ear candy and sentimental. There are 2 sets of romances and both are very well done. The 4 leads have good chemistry together. As a viewer I was actively rooting FOR both couples to get together as I thought they needed some long term happiness not just short bursts of joy. If a drama gets me invested, it's a good drama. All the acting was fantastic, even the side and smaller characters.The locations chosen for this show were varied and high quality. The Goblin's house for example, each room has a different feel, style and vibe. Canadian scenery set was wonderful. The field of buckwheat flowers. Snow. All in all the production budget spent on locations, costumes, props and special effects were well used. It worked to transport the viewer to different locales.  They managed to sneak in a fair amount of product placement too - visit Canada. Eat a steak there and bring back a maple leaf and was that a bottle of Canadian Maple Syrup? There's a lot of cars featured, and one subtle/prominent Tag Haeur watch. Also, for some strange reason, watching this will make you crave steak, wine, Soju and Olive Chicken. I don't know why. Actually I do know why, but I can't help it.Overall this is an almost perfect (editing could be tighter) blend of historical plus modern rom com with a dash of bromance thrown in. It's a must watch for those who like great Korean Drama.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Sometimes it isn't that way and if I ignore the fact that is much older then this couple would be pretty cute and funny. I originally wanted to watch this show because there were lots of videos with clips from this show and it was so funny so I wanted to try watching it. and because I have school so I don't have as much time during the day to watch it so I spend my nights watching and let me tell you it was worth it. I really want to watch it again even though I just finished it, but I kinda don't wanna go through the same tears again. Some parts made me so emotional and sad and I had to cry and the acting was so freaking good. The characters are sometimes super immature but it's entertaining to watch. The music is also pretty good because while I'm brushing my teeth I sometimes catch myself singing the lyrics of the opening song of the show. Overall I really enjoyed the show and the ending was enough for me to sleep well so I'll just end it here and find another drama to watch.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

The OST has so many great songs and I listen to it on Spotify a lot. The Grim/Goblin bromance is highly entertaining and brings depth to the characters. They have such good chemistry that you feel like you are part of the drama. The Sunny/Grim story line is one of my favorites. The characters are lovable, quirky, and sometimes socially awkward. If you want to see more from these two actors together watch “Touch Your Heart”, it doesn’t have the same emotional intensity as this drama but it is still a good watch. Secretary Kim dancing and singing to BTS & EXO in front of grandpa is hilarious. In many dramas this character would turn on everyone but I am glad to see that the character has unconditional loyalty to the Goblin. Kim Go Eun has so much energy in her high school character that it was making me tired watching her. Kudos to her make up artist and stylist that were able to make her look 10 years older and different from her high school character. She was able to tone down the energy but you still felt her passion. Gong Yoo, what can I say about this fabulous actor. Watch the extras, they will show you how fun and serious about his craft he is. I loved when they were in the movie theater and they were watching “Train to Busan” and he comments about the decline of Korean cinema. I laughed a little too hard when Sunny was describing the Goblin to the medium and she said “Gong Yoo.” It’s these kinds of “inside” jokes in dramas that I finally get after watching so many of them. I’m giving this drama 10 stars because there is character development and growth, the storyline is easy to follow and doesn’t have any blaring “jump the shark” moments. The OST adds to the drama and doesn’t distract the viewers from the story line. This may get some thumbs down but I’m going to say that the lack of PDA for this drama is a plus. There is a lot of looks of yearning but little physical contact until their relationship progresses. When there is kissing, its not a slow burn it’s like striking a match, quick and heated. I don’t feel like I’m being pandered to. Overall there is little to dislike unless you don’t like the genre, otherwise I highly recommend you watch it now!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

I have followed this drama most ardently even going to the extent of sitting up late at night to watch the drama within a few hours of its telecast. Goblin was a smashing hit in Korea and all over Asia. I am glad that, for once, Koreans and foreign viewers have loved and appreciated the same drama at the same time. For me, this drama is like the perfect coffee where everything is added in the right quantity just like the way I would like it. Comedy, romance, suspense, anguish, and action were so perfectly blended that I did not find this remarkable drama lacking in any department.Let’s weigh The Lonely Shining Goblin on our show beam balance and see what makes then show a praise-worthy, MUST watch drama.Good WeightsRollicking Comedy: Goblin is high on emotion and relationship but it is not short on comic scenes. Comedy scenes in the show were performed earnestly that it had to elicit rollicking laughter. Be it the grim reaper and the goblin’s banter or Eun Tak’s innocent demands from the goblin or Deok Hwa’s unreasonable needs, everything was hilarious. In a drama mostly depicting human values, the reasonable dosage of comedy provided the much-needed edge to the show.  BRomance: Though the romance on the show was decent it was the ‘bromance’ between goblin and the grim reaper that stole the show. I have not seen two male actors share such an easy yet fiery chemistry on-screen for a long time. Their banter and fights were hilarious. It broke my heart to see them hate each other for a brief period towards the end because I really enjoyed seeing them together.Perfect Cast: I have to say that the experienced cast on the show did a phenomenal job towards making the show what it is. The sincerity with which the cast performed was evident on-screen and the results are well-deserved. Even the supporting cast looked convincing in their roles. The casting of this show was one of the best I have seen in Kdramas.Magical Music: The show’s music is simply enchanting. In fact, the OST titled ‘Round and Round’ became such a big hit with the viewers that the show makers had to officially release it even when the producers had no intentions of keeping it in the original album. Of all the songs on the show ‘Stay With Me’ and ‘Round & Round’ are my most favourite songs.Bad WeightsViewers may find loopholes in the story but as far as I am concerned those minor little things did not bother me a bit. The overall content was so stupendous that I have no complaints whatsoever.I give The Lonely Shining Goblin 4.8 out 5 rating. I have never given any drama this high marks till date (not even my most favourite dramas) but Goblin deserves such high marks as it excels in every department be its story, screenplay, cast, direction, music and every single thing that completes this drama. I personally vouch for this drama. DO NOT MISS Goblin for anything. Go and watch it now.Originally posted on Alphagirl.in.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

"Jeem8157168","/profile/Jeem8157168","Jun 13, 2019","0","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      Goblin is the greatest K-Drama the world has ever see. One can never forget this series , if he has watched it. Don't worry about the hate reviews, just jump into the story. After finishing this one, you will be in deep thought about it over one month. The greatest story is mixed with overly talented actors and actresses. Gong Yoo , one of the best actors , mixed with Lee Dong Wook creates immense pleasure and brings humour to the whole plot. It is seen that there are some plot holes, but truly speaking, it's not worth talking about it. If you haven't watched Goblin , you will surely repent after watching all those other boring k-drama. Surely it is the most popular k-drama internationally. So you should give it a try. Afterlife stories, compensation for worldly crimes , life learning lessons mixed with loveliest ever romance between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun will be amazing to watch. This drama is best in every sense. Great graphics , great story , great cast, great ost, great cinematography. Better than any other Korean drama you have watched so far.Gong Yoo , portraying as Goblin (Kim Shin) couldn't have been better. I don't know how they chose cast but No one could have been better than Gong Yoo as the Goblin. The lines were way too emotional and his acting was too perfect. Every moment he was in the drama shined. His story of so many years and his previous tragedy will shake you to the peak of excitement. Vastly experienced Gong Yoo hits the hot spot again. One of the highest paid actors of Korea of all time and most popular actors of all time.Kim Go Eun , Ji Eun Tak , a girl with the ability to see ghosts meaning to be Goblin's Wife, played charming and amazing part. Everybody , literally every body said so many bad things about her and the drama for choosing her and making her so young. But truly , she has proved everyone wrong in the best possible way. The way she acted , felt like one of the greatest actresses of all time.Lee Dong Wook, The Greatest Interest of the show , combining with Gong Yoo by creating mesmerising Bromance , played the most difficult role of Grim Reaper and OMG , he was so great as Grim Reaper. The walking scenes of him and Gong Yoo literally made everyone's heart flutter. Though he played supporting actor but he is not a supporting actor rather one of the highest paid actors of all time in Korea.Yoo In Na , playing Kim Sun, came as a supporting actress in the drama. Same goes for her , always selected as a main lead. This is a big reason the drama was hit . Four of the best cast was massive to see at a time.Yoo In Na's acting was up to the mark and she portrayed her character so well . It was really great to see.Yeah, that sums up the review. Watch this amazing k-drama. Even if you create a vote poll for the best drama ever comparing with Dots, My love from the star , you will still see Goblin beating everyone. That shows how maximum people appreciated it. Don't just see the hate comments otherwise it wouldn't get 9.0 rating in total. Give it a go. Thank you so much for reading.

"Harriet Ho","/profile/Xiaopangpang","Jul 26, 2019","0","9.0","Overall 9.0    Story 9.5 Acting/Cast 10 Music 7.0 Rewatch Value 10      When I got invested into KPop properly last year, I started to invest my time into a few KDramas. Goblin was one of the dramas that I saw around as it is known as one of the most phenomenal dramas, but haven't watched it until now. As I knew this drama was one of the best, I did have high hopes that it would be an amazing one, and I am here to say, this drama is now my favourite drama of all time First of all, I would like to give credits to the writers for such an incredible storyline. I'm not really into watching stuff about supernatural creatures, but this drama made me very intrigued about the supernatural beings and it was for sure interesting to learn about Goblins and Grim Reapers.  The writers did a splendid job with connecting the stories of the characters with their past lifetimes and their strategic plans of piecing everything together. From my perspective, it is a very original storyline. Gong Yoo playing as Kim Shin/Goblin was mesmerising. Since watching this drama, I have developed a crush on him. He's got such a tender smile that could light up the entire universe. Every scene was such a treat. Every piece of happiness he got, the sadness and the laughs, all of those were portrayed so well for his character. So sweet, loveable, yet a past that was so unfortunate. It's also worth mentioning that I also fell in love with him because of his boyfriend/husband material: classy in style, funny, cute and a bit of a goofball.Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak was super cute and adorable. A lot of people found her annoying, but I found her behavior justifiable, but it really depends on how you look from it. Her character didn't really bother me at all, I loved her character and her development.Lee Dong Wook as Grim Reaper/Wang Yeo was a bit frightening due to his lack of expression haha, but I was really drawn into his character. I have never sympathise with a character just as much as him. Such a huge puppy in this drama and the best 'crier' I have seen yet.I loved all the cast, they portrayed their characters really well, amazing acting and I never wished for anyone different.The story is amazing. The love stories were phenomenal and story. Not only that, but the bromance between the Goblin and Grim Reaper was epic, I found myself shipping them more than the real lovers at times aha. The story will definitely leave you drowning in your own tears, but will certainly make your heart flutter and internally scream. It's funny, sad, beautiful, romantic, tragic, heartbreaking...The music for this drama was good, some of the songs were not really my cup of tea, but all of them were perfect for this drama. I'm glad that they used Round and Round for the intro, dramatic, yet so mysterious. Beautiful by Crush, Stay with Me and Round and Round are my main favourites.I find myself pondering on if I should rewatch this series again even though I just finished watching it. This is the first KDrama where I had thoughts on rewatching every single episode again from the very beginning. I am going to hold back for now, but I will certainly rewatch this again to relive those moments and find the time frames at where certain scenes happened.Definitely recommend this drama, it is worth watching. You know when a drama is good when you feel every emotion that the characters are feeling.It will certainly take me a long while to move on from this drama, if not I don't think I ever will  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

It was very unique and captivating to get any person to love this show. The chemistry with all of the characters/actors was just one of a kind. From main lead to second lead, both actors was able to have a chemistry that was sweet and respectful. Although, the main lead love interest started as a 19 year old. There was no appropriateness with it. The only complaint is that there were no true villain.  Soundtrack was sweet and easy listening, although it was very repetitive. It was still catchy. I would recommend this series to anyone that is new to watching k dramas.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

"OkayOrbit","/profile/OkayOrbit","Oct 14, 2018","0","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      The perfect fusion of fantasy and contemporary, with strong script-writing that allows for well-paced plot progression and stable character growth and characterisation. All the positives are backed up by a cast of hyper-competent actors who seem to be perfect matches for their roles, and a soundtrack composed by god herself. Definitely the drama I would recommend to first-time watchers.More than just a romance, the story also focuses on the importance of family, the one that you have through blood and birth, but also the one that you make for yourself. Perhaps my favourite parts of the drama were outside of the amazingly written romance portions, fantasy segments and action parts, but the small in-betweens where a family that consisted of a lonely Goblin, his greedy nephew, a Grim Reaper, and a teenage girl got to behave as a family, and eat meals together, tease each other and share advice.

"beatriz","/profile/bbeatrizz","Mar 19, 2019","0","10","Overall 10    Story 10 Acting/Cast 10 Music 10 Rewatch Value 10      They say that every book you read, every person you meet and every place you visit takes something from you and leaves something else in return. That’s how I feel about this drama. It’s the best way I can put into words how I feel about it. First, let me start by giving a little background of my experience with Goblin BEFORE watching it: when it came out, everyone was freaking out about it. I remember it all too well… the youtube videos, fan arts, twitter discussions… I don’t know why but I initially thought I would never, in this life, watch it and love it as much as them. Maybe because I was fairly new to this world and was scared of dramas with historical references? Or did I think it was too complicated for me to understand what was going on? Was I scared because the actors were a bit older than what I was used to? I don’t know, but I simply decided that it was not for me. Years went by. One day, a few weeks ago, I was scrolling down a thread on twitter about funny drama moments and they included a scene from Goblin and I thought “Maybe I should give it a try.” But ended up brushing it off. But a few days later after that, I was on dramatist reading the articles and casually read the “most popular” list. Goblin was (is) there. And SUDDENLY I GOT THIS URGE TO WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY AS IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT! And so I did. The destin is a real thing, guys.ANYWAYS, BACK TO THE REVIEW Usually, I review each part of the drama, starting with the plot, but for some reason I’m not strong enough to write a full review today. Maybe after I rewatch it (because that will certainly happen). There’s plenty to talk about: the engaging and beautiful- even if painful- plot, the splendid acting and cast who portrayed unforgettable characters, the best OST of all time, the relieving feeling it leaves behind when it’s over. I feel like everyone went through so much that I just wanted them to have an ending- at some points I thought a happy ending was impossible for them. The dialogue is absolutely incredible. You cry and laugh like crazy in less than 5 minutes. The friendships in these are- oh my god. The first episode is the best episode of a drama I’ve ever watched. Like, honestly, the first 20 minutes of the first episode made me cry because of how good those scenes were. And I felt the need to write a live commentary of me watching the rest of the episode, which was a first for me. So here it is, my reaction to the first episode, written by me on Sunday, March 10th 2019: //COMMENTARYEPISODE 1-So… I just watched the first 20 minutes. Literally the best twenty minutes of any drama I’ve ever watched. The war was… mind-blowing, I can’t describe what I felt. The acting is INSANE. No words. Simply no words.And now I want to learn all about Korean history (even more than before). Great.-27 minutes in and this little boy made me laugh soooo hard. “Why are you speaking informally to my grandpa? Do you want to die?” HAHAHA so cute-48:00 … my heart is broken. Will I be able to deal with this drama? I don’t think so.I am dead. I’m literally dead. This is my ghost writing this.-This is going to make my Top 5 list, isn’t it?//Yes, yes it is.This show will stay very high on my list for a long time, I can feel it. So refreshing. I knew what would happen to Goblin because I had seen many references to it on social media and basically everywhere? But NOTHING could have prepared me for that scene. It was my first time watching the whole scene and I SOBBED. And then I was happy. I was so happy by the last episode. And then- Oh well, we suffered along with the characters, didn’t we? But I wouldn’t change a thing. By the way, now that I’m thinking about that, a sequel wouldn’t hurt anyone, would it? It would make perfect sense if it was well written… but the perfection that is Goblin shouldn’t be changed. It should just stay as it is and nothing more than that. I’m so thankful for this drama because I was able to finally get over my prejudice of historical dramas (only if we only got a glimpse of it, I’m more confident and comfortable to watch one of those because I found out I can really love the story even if I’m scared of the genre) and of dramas I thought I would never watch if my life. What an irony. And maybe I'll give Descendants of the Sun a try too! I’m happy that (at last) I know why so many people adored this drama back then and wouldn’t shut up about it and why it remains among so many people’s favorites. I got it. The actors are amazing (both male and female actors!!!) and we will all love them eternally. I got it.And I had decided to write only a short review with an impactful (and very pretentious) statement but I ended up ranting about it. Oh well, I regret nothing.

I had always for some reason found reasons to not watch this cause even without reading the description of the drama I had a feeling it would be a tragedy I had a feeling I would cry many buckets of tears, but after let’s say 2 months I finally got the courage to watch it.... and as soon as I started I was ADDICTED the start was just amazing the story straightaway started with something that captivates the viewers completely I won’t say what happened since this isn’t one of those reviews that contain spoilers.Although this drama uses CGI it wasn’t exaggerated or maybe it was just really well done I mean that ship scenes damn.... usually some fantasy dramas use CGI so much that the whole drama looks fake and I mean it’s fantasy obviously it will be fake but it gets to a certain point where it’s almost cringey but this drama was not like that.The actors did an amazing job they conveyed the characters so well and they had so much chemistry in the drama and in the BTS, I think we really have to give the actors an applause for their crying scenes cause honestly every time they cried I felt it, I remember there was a part that Kim Go Eun cried (she played Ji Eun Tak) and her cries sounded to melancholy and so real the way she gasping for air I myself just couldn’t stop crying with her. There were also many times the actors improvised themselves trying to make the scene funnier or more correspondent to their character they just did an amazing job!The Director, the film crew, the scriptwriters, the CGI group and oh my god the makeup crew that deserve a huge applause the way they made a young person look old with makeup was just amazing, they did 5 hours of make up on just one person I feel bad for the actress that had to come 5 hours early just to get her makeup done.The music was also very well chosen they made some scenes so much more emotional or some so much more romantic it was just amazing.Overall I give the  drama a 10/10  they did fantastic with practically everything I hope my review persuades you to watch this drama and let me warn you about the tears that will just flow out of your eyes, I hope your ready! And if your wondering about the ending.... it was bitter sweet. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

This story is very interesting and well-developed - with the story spanning across centuries.  The twists in the story were unexpected and very craftily woven.  The two lead actors are good looking.  Good looking actors and actresses often help.In comparison to Chinese dramas, the male characters in Korean dramas tend to be more chauvinistic in behaviour.  This may because Chinese dramas have been under scrutiny not to portrait certain values or indeed Chinese society especially in the larger cities have become a lot more receptive to women's status in the society.The English title of this drama, however, was very poorly translated.  A goblin is an ugly dwarf-like creature.  But the lead character is handsome and tall - a complete mismatch.  Wonder whether the translator knew this. A better title could be Immortal, Demi-god, Burden of the Past or the like of these.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

You probably read all the amazing reviews about how beautiful it is so I;m not going to repeat anything. Goblin is  a 10 for sure and just kinda perfect but also at the same time I had my few opinions. And here they areAGE DIFFERENCE  (very controverial)- The age difference is a little weird... but the romance is too beautiful and tragic to even look at that. I highly disagree with people who think they had no chemistry and instead had a father-daughter relationship.  Ar first I was highly weird out and disgusted by the age difference but I looked over it and you will to. Hopefully. What's more weird is the fact that Gong Yoo looks 40 10 years ago and today's time as well. Koreans are usualy younger looking so I didn't expect him to look that old for a korean but hey not every korean is younger looking and so representation matters lolSECOND COUPLE- Second couple didn't really grow on me.  It was just there... I would have loved it if the gream reaper and goblin fell for the same girl. Now how controversial and  conflicting is that! However that would ruin the bromance and I refuse to sacrifice the most amazing bromance in the history of kdrama for that thought.MUSICTHE BESTTTTTTTTTTTTT.

I'm going to start by saying that I'm not typically a fan of age gap romances at all, but I feel like there was a purpose in Goblin for the ages and the writers did a great job with their relationship development.  They didn't do anything illegal in terms of intimacy while she was 19 - they had one peck when she tried pulling out the sword. They didn't kiss again until she was 20 and they didn't go further than that until she was 29 (if we go off of implication). Yes, when she was 19, Kim Shin admitted that she was his first love, but why is that inappropriate when she would age and he wouldn't? You have to remember that he's essentially stuck at the same physical age and his loved ones all age around him. And if she's fated to be his true love, he will love her at any age. From young to old. In addition to that, the love he feels for her isn't just about romance. Plus, the reason she was 9, 19, and 29 is because of the whole '9' thing in the show, so she couldn't be slightly older or younger than 19 at the age they met.  I think I would have had problem with the age gap if they kissed properly (or went further) while she was still a minor, but they didn't because this series is about their fated true love and how they'll always meet. It's a beautiful story of their sad love and life. Age isn't really in the equation. Story: I loved the entire story. It kept my attention so that I was never bored - despite the episodes being long. The writing was amazing most of the time. I laughed, smiled, squealed, cried, and even got scared by that asshole evil soul who shall not be named. Plus, I loved the fantasy and supernatural theme of the show. It had all the right ingredients to make me fall in love with the drama: romance, fantasy, supernatural, comedy, angst, found family and bromance. The development between Wang Yeo and Kim Shin honestly brought me to tears. Ugh. Anyway, the last four episodes kind of brought down the rating for me a little because everyone was taking turns dying or leaving. But, it does make sense for the show. All the characters were great too, there wasn't a single one I hated. Acting/Cast: Incredible acting from the entire cast. Although I love Gong Yoo and he played his role perfectly, I feel like he would have been better suited for the role 5 years beforehand. Music: Perfect.Rewatch value: If I have time, I might rewatch this.Overall: I highly recommend watching this if you haven't yet. It really is such a good drama.

The production is so good, the story is compelling and it will really hook you up, I was never a fan of fantasy dramas that's why I watched this years after release but this opened my door to watching some dramas with fantasy elements.My highlights of the film are Eun Tak's acting, her acting feels so real most of the times especially with the sad scenes, I also loved Sunny's character and how can we talk about Goblin without the OST?

But it was hard for me to make a review. Cause if you think about it… the plot is amazing, the performances are amazing, soundtrack is amazing, filming direction is amazing, special effects are amazing and it is rewatchable. So you cannot possibly give a bad grade. Like I can’t give less than 8.5 and a strong 9/10 is also understandable. In a way when we talk about the real K drama with comedy, romance and all, we want this. An interesting and original plot AND great performances which is often lacking and often judged nowadays in a way I don’t like… Like Alchemy’s of souls or My demon or A good day to be a dog or King the land (to name a few recents) are strongly lacking in good performances. And Goblin doesn’t. But in a way there is something a bit bothering which I have a hard time to explain. The age gap between the characters (characters not actors) is one of them but not only and that is why it was hard for me to give a review. Like… if it’s perfecr why does it feel imperfect ? still worth watching at least once in your lifetime   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

I get it now. I understand all the high ratings. I understand the love for this drama. I understand it all.This drama was just too high quality for me. It is a masterpiece, through and through. Everything about it. A few points:- Stunning scenery & cinematography- Gorgeous soundtrack, beautiful (just put on Winter is Coming.mp3 or And I'm Here.mp3 and I’ll be a wreck)- Quality storyline- Slow and steady pacing- Great acting- Superb chemistry for our main 2 romantic couples (and bromance couple)I took my time watching this show in order to savour its beauty. This show was such a rollercoaster. Since there is a lot of angst, when our characters smile, it is like seeing the sun come out after years of rain. You’ll have the fluffiest scenes of all time that you are unprepared for and then more angst comes and smacks you in the face. But god I loved it all - it made me feel SO many things. I had never seen two characters that encapsulated the word ‘soulmates’ like Kim Shin and Ji Eun Tak. Those lovers deserve the world and more.My final thoughts are the immense satisfaction and gratification for allowing myself to watch this paragon of a drama.

I fell in love with each and every character like they were real people in my life.  If I could recommend any drama, it would be Goblin.

I researched both the two main leads, Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun.  I must say Gong Yoo is NOT BAD at all.  I can understand why everything that they say about you being one of Korea's best actors.    Well, here is my 4th best kisser!   I can understand why you said you were tired after doing this movie,  you put your heart into this one.   For a minute I thought Kim Go Eun might've been too young for you but I was surely shocked to know this actress was 28 years old.   She is aging well, she looks like a teenager.    She did very well in this as well.   The other 3 main leads, in - Yoo In Na who played Sunny, Yook Sung Jae who played Yoo Deok Hwa, and Lee Dong Wook who played the  Grim Reaper;  this TVDrama couldn't be done without all of you.   You all were fantastic and great acting!   The visual effects were well done but I would have loved to have seen more.   I still gave it a 10 rating because of the storyline and the acting performance.   The music was also very good on the ears.    NOTE:   I can hardly wait for Deng Lun's remake of ""Goblin"".

Since I'm the type to get easily put off over a series if there's way too much hype over a series by fandom to the point that it dampens one's mood to keep watching. So I'm glad that I finally able to enjoy this drama properly. It's great to be able to enjoy the series without having the pressure to have to like it just because a lot of people also love the drama.Anyway, I always love a fantasy-themed drama, and Goblin also combined two narratives from the Goryeo period and the modern period and turned it into a beautiful love story. That was enough to make the story interesting and I really love how the writing flows beautifully to flawlessly integrate the three elements into a great story. That aside, I love how well the characters were written to be so endearing and well-loved. I especially love the secondary love story between the Grim Reaper and Sunny as well as the complicated relationship between Grim Reaper and the Goblin. Which made one can't help but keep tuning in to see how the three characters, whose relationships extended past several lifetimes could reconcile with each other once they realize each other's identities. That aside, it was really endearing to see a shy and timid goblin being paired with an awkward and adorable drama-loving grim reaper as they try to figure out their places in the world and find out the purpose of their existence while paving their own 'happy endings'.

Literally the only complaint I can think of is that the story drags a little bit when I wanted more elsewhere, so I wish that time was used a little better, but it's really only a criticism when compared to itself because the story is mostly amazing and well paced. Other than that, I can't think of anything I would change. The acting is amazing, the styling and cinematography is gorgeous, and the OST is hands down my favorite of any drama. Don't let the age gap freak you out, it serves a metaphorical purpose in the story (the motif of the seasons) and we as the viewers know that no one is being taken advantage of. This is one of those shows I have to stop myself from comparing every other show to, because if I did, very few things would measure up.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Deep emotions yet not emo throughout.  Second lead relationship definitely more ship-worthy than the first lead relationship in this drama.  To me the story dragged, the chemistry was quietly simmering throughout in a beautifully shot drama.  Rather than situational conflicts, the drama was more about character interactions so relied more heavily on proper acting.  Fortunately, the leads were well-cast and met those expectations.  Had to force myself to finish this one.

The cast was flawless!  Its not often that a drama's lead and second lead couples are equally strong and with the added bonus of a bromance that was every bit as compelling as the romances. The story is beautiful and well told, yet something about it just misses the mark for me.I guess I didn't quite understand why the Goblin was being punished so severely. And is it me, but was there A LOT of crying? I felt like I cried A LOT.  I don't mind ""the feels"", but by episode 9 it started to feel almost gratuitous.  Goblin had many funny scenes as well.  The casting was superb!  But was there one episode where at least one character did not cry?  I must mention that the OST is AMAZING and definitely contributed to ""the feels"".  I looked forward to hearing Never Far Away each and every episode. 16 episodes was perfect and Gobllin is definitely worth a watch, but this is not a drama I would rewatch, not even for certain scenes.

Somewhere between all of the episodes made me realize how important life is, and how we should cherish it as if we are going to die tomorrow. (I know we are in quarantine, but there is still stuff we can do even if we are locked down) The actors and actresses really portrait their character significantly. The story is somewhat similar to the 'Hotel Del Luna' but things can't really be the same especially if it's different characters and settings. The cinematography was insane!!!!, the funny moments with Grim and Goblin were hilarious which is the reason why I started watching this drama.  The ending kind of made me confused but I sorta understand where they are going at... but I wish Sunny and 'KIM WOO BIN' had more screen time and more ""dates"". I find their relationship very rom-com -idy than Eun Tak and Goblin. But I still like the romances that they have. The way they first met, first love, and first sadness....? This drama also showed me how dedicated he was to Eun Tak, he was patient to wait for her even if he is a 'LONELY GOD' This quote; ""There is no sadness that lasts for eternity. There is no love that lasts for eternity either."" and Eun Tak voted for ""Sad love""... This quote teared me up because the commitment she is doing is just sooo amazing and a life lesson. I wish that for anyone who is looking for love or is in love, I wish for yall to be dedicated as them... This is true love!!! Overall, this made me cry!, laugh, smile, cringe, and made me jealous xDAfter watching this, it inspired me to keep going and push on in life!The comedy in this drama will stay with me forever! HAHAH! I also loved how Deok-Hwa is the pabo person in the drama...evne though it's mostly Grim and Goblin.After watching Sungjae in this drama, I began to miss 'WE GOT MARRIED' with JOY T.TAnyways!

I had my reservations, ironically because this is a hit. I didn't enjoy hits like DOTS so I was quite skeptical about this drama too. Watched it anyway and enjoyed it thoroughly:)  Firstly, all the logic fell into place nicely and the flow of the drama is great, so I can follow and immerse into the story quite well. (except for that part of Sunny's restaurant business..) Secondly, the characters are planned out nicely and uniquely interesting. Lastly, the bromance, womance, romance and kinship is displayed appropriately. I am glad that there are relationships other than romance, making the story much for believable. I enjoyed the story maybe except that the drama did a lot of recaps so I have to fast forward every time there is one.   I didn't quite believe that there will be chemistry between the two leads, but they really impressed me!!! Sunny and Grim Reaper also displayed their subtle chemistry that I liked a lot. I was totally taken in by Grim Reaper!!! All other characters really performed well and deserves a 10/10 (INCLUDING THOSE NOT-SO-CAMEO CAMEOS)  All the OSTs was great, just that the (airy) track by Soyou wasn't quite enjoyable for me.

I immediately fell in love with the Reaper and Goblin characters without even touching a episode first.So after seeing those two videos on Youtube I went to watch the first episode.The story of how Goblin came to be was intriguing and seeing how the Reaper worked had me as well so I became giddy thinking this was going to be an excellent watch.Man how wrong was I??? The main FL became annoying pretty quick. I was hoping against hope that this wasn't going to be a dimwitted female who will fall in love quickly without having any relationship buildup and there it was....the dimwitted female who quickly falls in love with a guy without having a relationship buildup. It's why I became to hate Korean romance dramas in the first place.The oozing sappy cliche romances always grate my nerves and I truly steer clear of them. I have, however, watched some Kdramas that had romance in it that was barely tolerable but this one...I felt it was just going to be the same throughout the whole series.I tried going back to finish the first episode but I just kept pausing and haven't been back since. I can't say anything else about this drama because I barely finished the first episode. From reading other reviews that had the same feelings as me, I don't think I'm missing anything.

Toute une bonne partie du drama est tressée de tragique et de comique, avec la relation excellente et tordante du Gobelin et de l’Ange de la Mort jusqu’au moment où les réincarnations se révèlent et où la tragédie prend le pas sur la comédie, sans pour autant qu’elle disparaisse complètement : (les adieux de Wang Yeo, si bouleversants, qui se terminent sur le conseil de ne pas oublier d’étendre la lessive...)L’histoire de l’Âme perdue, épouse du Gobelin m’a vraiment touchée, de sa naissance à sa mort, sa capacité à assumer un destin implacable, sa force et sa clarté d’âme, j’ai trouvé que c’était un très beau personnage et une belle idée scénaristique. Mais l’actrice m’a souvent tapé sur les nerfs par son ton pleurnichard ou « petite fille », parlant toujours comme si elle était enrhumée… enfin, je suis très difficile avec les actrices coréennes, je l’avoue !L’idée de la punition divine changeant les pêcheurs (graves, hein, pas les voleurs de poule !  )en Ange de la Mort, qui doit exister dans la mythologie coréenne parce que déjà vue, jumelée avec la problématique de la réincarnation, ça m’a aussi énormément plu ! Un bon point pour Lee Dong Wokqui est beaucoup remonté dans mon estime, surtout après l’avoir vu dans Life ! Il faut dire que je baigne dans la mythologie japonaise, et que chez eux aussi les yokaï  et autres monstres peuplent le quotidien et les fantômes ne sont jamais loin ! Donc ça aide ! Je n’ai donc pas eu de mal à suivre tout ça et particulièrement le tout dernier épisode, où, je pense qu’il s’est passé bien plus de trente ans quand reviennent Sunny et Wang Yeo, enfin réunis grâce aux nombreuses lanternes magiques envoyées par Kim Shin ! On sent bien que le temps passe, dure, s’éternise pour Kim Shin, qui erre et traine sa solitude douloureuse, puis apaisée. Et bien sûr que la nouvelle Eun Tak le reconnaît ! N’a-t-elle pas refusé le thé de l’oubli ? Ne le cherche-t-elle pas ? ça c’est une idée qui me plaît, et qui est bien consolante ! (cependant ça ne durera qu’une vie, ou même 3, et ensuite, la solitude éternelle pour Kim Shin… ça c’est moins drôle, mais peut-être remplira-t-il son éternité de bonnes actions ! ) J’aime beaucoup le personnage de Sunny,bien dans la ligne de Kim Sun, qui refuse l’oubli salvateur, mais qui maintient la punition de Wang Yeo jusqu’au bout, bien que Kim Shin ait fini par lui pardonner. Toujours dans les compliments, la musique, vraiment belle, les chansons très supportables et même belles pour certaines, la beauté des images, l’élégance des effets spéciaux, … et la magnifique garde-robe de Gong Yoo, d’une classe et d’une élégance peu courante dans les dramas (d’ailleurs il doit avoir un costumier attitré, depuis longtemps, je m’étais fait la même remarque déjà pour Coffee Prince !)Bon, les défauts :  la longueur des épisodes, avec des review longs et inutiles, des pauses-regards, des ralentis excessifs (surtout dans les deux premiers épisodes), l’usage du bruit sonore des pas trop répété, une prise de son qui ne laisse rien passer des bruits secondaires (papier froissé par exemple) mais tout ça n’est pas grand chose, et surtout une fin un peu décevante après la magnifique, flamboyante et déchirante fin de l’épisode 13 !Il fallait pourtant régler des questions, mais là il y avait un choix à faire :retour ou pas pour Kim Shin ? moi, je suis radicale,ma fin :  il ne revient pas, la vie continue pour les autres, qui ont tout oublié (sauf L’Ange) le dernier départ de l’Ange aurait été celui de Eun Tak très longtemps après…. pour terminer sur la rencontre d’une autre Eun Tak, d’un autre Kim Shin, qui bien que ne se connaissant pas et n’ayant aucun souvenir l’un de l’autre, ne peuvent s’empêcher de tomber amoureux au premier regard…ce qui évite au malheureux Gong Yoo une éternité de solitude inéluctable, ce qui est long, surtout vers la fin, comme chacun sait ! La fin, je lai trouvée mollassonne  jusqu’au départ de l’Ange et de Sunny, très réussi et touchant, alors que  celui de Eun Tak ne m’a pas convaincue, trop long et surtout l’air de ravie de la crèche permanent de l’actrice me gênait, malgré le talent de Gong Yoo dont le chagrin était déchirant et  profond. Pourquoi fallait-il la faire mourir à ce moment-là ? je n’en vois pas trop la raison ! ça leur fait perdre 50 ans sans raison !  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Estava errada. Comecei e ter um interesse mais profundo próximo do episodio 8, e daí para frente não teve mais volta. Achei extremamente interessante a forma como os personagens se chamavam pelo papel deles, e não pelos nomes: Trabalho-de-meio-período, Tio-do-final-do-corredor, etc.Achei interessante a forma como no início os dois nitidamente não se gostam. Não é como se eles se odiassem nem nada assim, só não se gostam mesmo. A impressão que dá é que o Goblin pensa ""Sério que eu esperei 900 anos por essa garota?"" hahahaha. É bonito ver como a relação deles vai se desenvolvendo aos poucos, não dá para dizer com certeza quando eles começam a se amar. O casal secundário começou bem, mas depois perdi um pouco o interesse neles. Ri várias vezes, e me emocionei. O final foi angustiante, triste e lindo ao mesmo tempo. É aquele tipo de dorama que te dá vontade esquecer e ver tudo de novo. As músicas são perfeitas, pouquíssimos doramas tiveram esse efeito em mim, as músicas são perfeitas, lindas demais (exceto ""Beautiful"" essa eu não gostei). Algumas pontas ficaram soltas, é verdade, mas não muitas. Indico com certeza.   Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

O casal mais sem química de todos os K-dramas  Eu simplesmente não entendo o hype em torno dessa série, por isso resolvi escrever essa resenha. Goblin foi um dos primeiros k-dramas que eu assisti e foi por conta de muitas pessoas me indicarem. Ele também fez com que eu quase desistisse de assistir coisas do mesmo gênero, pois os episódios foram se arrastando e eu tive que me forçar a terminar. Vou listar alguns pontos sobre a série:1. Química do casalNunca vi um casal tão sem graça! Eles não tem compatibilidade, na maioria do tempo o relacionamento é irritante e infantil. O casal secundário acaba sendo mais envolvente... Como a série foca no romance e o casal não tem química, isso prejudica muito o andamento e os episódios ficam arrastados e difíceis de ver. 2. EnredoEu costumo gostar de séries de fantasia, mas achei essa um pouco forçada. É interessante a forma como ele se tornou um Goblin e a sua convivência com o Grim Reaper (ponto mais engraçado da série), mas o romance é fraco e precisa ter muita força de vontade para acreditar nele. A história começa bem, mas por volta de 1/3 ela começa a se arrastar. 3. Fotografia e trilha sonoraPor mais que eu não tenha gostado da série, dois pontos positivos são a fotografia e a trilha sonora. Sem essas coisas eu acho que realmente teria sido impossível terminar.Por fim, eu queria dizer que se uma série está super em alta, mas ela não faz o seu estilo, você não precisa se forçar a terminar. Eu aprendi essa lição assistindo Goblin e hoje em dia eu não tenho medo de ""dropar""uma série só porque todo mundo gostou. O mundo dos dramas é muito vasto e com certeza tem uma série com o seu estilo esperando por você.  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"
"dawnraptor","/profile/dawnraptor","Aug 17, 2022","1","8.5","Overall 8.5    Story 9.0 Acting/Cast 9.0 Music 8.5 Rewatch Value 8.0    Originale, straziante ma pieno di speranza. In un mare di drama dove il motore che spinge e arresta le relazioni è la gelosia fra gli attori principali e secondari, Goblin (Guardian: the lonely and great god) spicca per la sua originalità nella trama e nella gestione delle relazioni. La gelosia farà capolino solo di striscio, e sarà men che secondaria.Soprattutto, è la trama ad essere molto originale, decisamente diversa da qualsiasi cosa abbia mai visto.Un invincibile generale della dinastia Goryeo viene falsamente accusato di tradimento e assassinato assieme a tutta la sua famiglia da un re geloso e sobillato. La spada che gli piantano in petto lo condanna ad essere un goblin immortale, fino a quando non incontrerà la sua sposa, l’unica che potrà estrarre la spada e liberarlo dal peso dell’immortalità. Nel frattempo, il nostro generale/goblin fa conoscenza anche di un dio della morte e di varie altre persone…Diciamolo subito: a parte le prime scene, di un’energia pazzesca, l’azione non è il comparto principale di questa serie. Ma Gong Yoo, nei panni del generale Kim Shin, è quanto di più vigorosamente maschio si possa immaginare, senza sconfinare nei palestrati. Anche in abiti civili, Gong Yoo è un attore coi controfiocchi: espressivo il giusto, maturo e coinvolgente senza essere eccessivo.Mai sopra le righe, sembra essere il mantra di questa produzione. Diktat a cui si uniforma anche Lee Dong Wook, nei panni del grim reaper, un tipo piuttosto impacciato e chiaramente a disagio nei rapporti interpersonali. Il suo personaggio è per certi versi un po’ tonto, e si è calato benissimo nella parte.La giovanissima Kim Go Eun, che ha magistralmente interpretato la sposa del goblin, ha saputo mantenere alla grande il suo ruolo di collante centrale a quasi tutte le vicende.Un nutrito stuolo di spalle è riuscito a reggere alla grande il passo di questo magnifico trio. Tutti gli attori, fino alle comparse, hanno fatto un lavoro egregio, una vera gioia per gli occhi, e spesso un colpo al cuore.Se, specialmente all’inizio, non sono mancate situazioni divertenti, che hanno alleggerito l’atmosfera, verso la fine a prevalere è la tragedia, anche se non così definitiva come si potrebbe pensare. (Eppure, io ancora mi domando quale sarà il destino del solitario goblin.)Ma non solo di tragedie e amori difficili o impossibili si nutre questo drama. Inserite qua e là, come perle nascoste, ci sono frasi che fanno pensare, che ci parlano per esempio di come il destino a volte ci dia una spinta, se abbiamo fortuna, ma avvisandoci che il resto della strada dobbiamo farla da soli. Ci sono momenti di altissima poesia, lettere e citazioni che rimarranno impresse per molto tempo.Il regalo di un orologio sarà accompagnato da questo biglietto: “Per tutti i sentieri su cui cammineremo insieme, per tutti i paesaggi che vedremo insieme, con cuore timido ed emozionato, con tutte le domande e le risposte. In tutti quei momenti, ti amo.”La storia si dipana senza eccessive vicende secondarie, forse a volte rallentando un po' troppo ma, ad essere sinceri, non saprei neppure io cosa tagliare per snellire. Alla fine, tutto è necessario e, soprattutto, originale nel concetto e nello svolgimento. Le relazioni fra gli avvenimenti di 900 anni prima e dopo sono perfettamente spiegate e bilanciate, i personaggi convergono sul palcoscenico come attirati dal magnete del destino. E se in principio Kim Shin sembrava un bambino capriccioso e la sposa una ragazzina troppo vivace, le peculiarità delle loro vite possono spiegare molte cose. Il tempo e le interazioni portano crescite caratteriali importanti.Ora, so che da più parti si sono alzate voci di dissenso all’idea di una storia d’amore fra una ragazzina di 19 anni e un uomo di 39 (più 900). Sarei stata anch’io fra quelle voci ma, in realtà, finché la sposa era giovanissima la relazione fra i due è rimasta molto delicata, praticamente platonica. Solo più avanti, quando lei è cresciuta, è evoluto anche il loro rapporto.E' molto ben riuscita la bromance (senza alcuna connotazione BL) fra i due protagonisti principali. La loro amicizia ha aggiunto sale e pepe alla storia.Giustizia vuole che si parli dell’ottima cinematografia, delle ambientazioni, dei costumi, tutto molto curato e piacevole. Un discorso a parte merita la colonna sonora, impreziosita da alcune canzoni, specialmente l’opening, che non dimenticherò facilmente. Ma anche le musiche di sottofondo vantano alcune tracce molto belle, che ben sottolineano l’azione.Questa serie mi ha stregato, sono rimasta incollata alla sedia per tre giorni di fila, imprecando quando dovevo staccarmi per fare altro. Insomma, un drama che consiglio caldamente, a meno che non si sia allergici alle lacrime, perché in questo caso le cose si metterebbero male. Come dice il saggio, prima di poter migliorare le cose devono peggiorare.So che altri la ritengono una noiosissima fiera del cliché. Provare è l'unica strada. A me è piaciuto.

O casal secundário possui muito mais química e carisma do que o principal, e além disso, a história é boa, mas muito mal executada. Os episódios se resumiam em flashbacks e cenas irrelevantes todo capítulo, prejudicando bastante o enredo e apenas enchendo linguiça pra terem episódios enormes e te deixar quase dormindo.

A ambientação dos personagens em suas vidas passadas é impecável, a fotografia é belíssima, e a atmosfera fantástica foi muito bem construída. No entanto, como em outros dramas de Kim Eun Sook, o enredo me perdeu da metade para o final. Tudo começou a parecer mais uma grande propaganda do que um drama com uma história consistente e envolvente.Kim Eun Sook tem o hábito de recorrer a reviravoltas baratas para prender a atenção do público, mas isso acaba tornando o enredo previsível e desinteressante. Nenhum dos casais me convenceu. A ideia de um ser sobrenatural como o Goblin, que viveu 939 anos, atravessou várias épocas, e acumulou quase todo o conhecimento do mundo, mas nunca se envolveu com ninguém, e de repente se apaixona perdidamente pela protagonista adolescente ainda no ensino médio, é difícil de engolir. Sei que ela é sua ""noiva"" e que isso faz parte da fantasia e da maldição dele, mas convenhamos, é uma premissa complicada de aceitar.A protagonista também é constantemente retratada como uma pessoa especial por conta de seu sofrimento, mas sua vida, embora marcada por desafios, não me convenceu de que isso a tornava tão única. O drama força a ideia de que sofrimento cria um charme particular, mas muitas pessoas passam por dificuldades semelhantes, e isso não necessariamente faz delas algo extraordinário.O casal secundário, por outro lado, foi simplesmente insuportável para mim. Eu detestava cada segundo que eles apareciam na tela. O ceifador, em especial, era extremamente infantil para alguém que lida com a morte e questões complexas sobre a vida. O tom “fofo” que tentaram dar ao personagem não funcionou, e a sua infantilidade me afastou ainda mais de qualquer empatia que eu poderia sentir por ele.No geral, Goblin começou com uma promessa grandiosa, mas terminou com uma sensação de superficialidade, algo que me decepcionou profundamente.

Los protagonistas ,Gong Yoo( kim shin) y Kim Go-eun (ji eun tak), ellos pueden tener una gran diferencia de edad pero eso no fue un impedimento para que la química fuera tan natural y a la vez hot lol, su historia de amor es tan trágica y tan bonita, la manera de como él espero por ella 300 años, siiii 300 AÑOSS!!!, es verdad que al comienzo no se llevan tan bien, e incluso kim shin es un poco frio con ella pero mientras pasan los capítulos te vas dando cuenta de que él solo la quiere proteger y tiene miedo de enamorarse de ella porque cuando le saque la espada tendrá que irse (spoiler eso pasa), su relación se desarrollo sí es verdad un poco raro pero muy cute y divertido.Ahora hablemos de las escenas más emotivas y dolorosas del drama: cuando mi niña (ji eun tak) se sacrifica por los niños, y mi nene (kim shin) sabe que algo malo ha pasado y se rencuentran con la parca y los dos empiezan a llorar, NOO de solo recordarlo ya me duele, otra escena que es de mis favoritas y de las escenas finales, él está leyendo un libro en el lugar donde ellos empezaron a conocerse y enamorarse (Canadá), y ella recuerda la icónica y dolorosa frase donde Kim Shin le dice:""NO HAY TRISTEZA QUE DURE CIEN AÑOS, NI AMOR QUE SEA PARA LA ETERNIDAD"" y ella le responde    ""SI LO HAY"" él le pregunta  ¿AMOR O TRISTEZA?  ella responde ""UN TRISTE AMOR"", ayy no puedo más.Bueno gente esa fue mi pequeña review de este increíble drama, me falto hablar de los personajes secundarios pero eso deberían verlo por ustedes, solo quiero decir de que si todavía no lo han visto, qué están esperando, se están perdiendo de una JOYA de historia, pero bueno eso es solo mi opinión.

Acabo de terminar de ver GOBLIN después de haber tenido ganas  de mirarlo mucho tiempo. Estas son mis impresiones: 1. La historia es hermosa pero el supuesto final feliz no deja de ser amargo. Fue terriblemente triste. Ella renació como una colegiala otra vez. El tendrá que verla envejecer y morir nuevamente porque el sigue siendo inmortal. Luego ella tendrá  dos vidas mas ... y después que? . Era mejor que el Goblin hubiera regresado siendo mortal para poder envejecer y morir como ella.(Personalmente pienso que  ser inmortal viviendo en esta tierra así como esta no es saludable para nadie. Tampoco creo en la reencarnación pero no deja de ser una premisa interesante desde el lado de la fantasia). 2. La amistad del Goblin con el Angel de la muerte...  absolutamente genial!3.La historia del ángel de la muerte y Sunny me impactó mucho mas que la de la pareja principal.  Ella lo amaba pero no podía perdonarlo  (y con razón),   y el la amaba  pero ya no era un ser humano vivo, sino una herramienta logística de la muerte y es desgarrador ver como se la pasa consumido por la culpa , el anhelo y el dolor.  También es impactante como parecen estar marcados, sellados uno para el otro para volver a enamorarse en cualquier vida, solo con una mirada. Así que tuvieron que ir a otra vida  donde no recuerdan nada para poder estar juntos.  Que hermosa, trágica,  triste, y dolorosa historia. Y Como actuaron de bien esos dos!. Creo que no voy a poder olvidarlos. 3. Gong Yo es un tremendo actor y la actriz que  hace de su novia tambien.  Pero es cierto que es muy poco creible que un hombre de 939 años pueda enamorarse de una adolescente de 19.  Casi un siglo de vida convertiria a una persona en alguien con una psiquis  compleja, probablemente un ser hastiado y muy difícil de impresionar.4. La cinematografía fue preciosa.5. La musica.... estupenda!!!. La canción de la entrada, round and round es WOOOOOWWW epica. Tambien  me gustan: Beautiful, hush y  stand with me. En resumen creo que si es un drama en conjunto memorable que quedara en mi corazon siempre.

El duende, Dokkaebi, y la “novia del Ser Inmortal.Siempre leía que era un drama que había que ver sí o sí. Y no puedo entender cómo tardé tanto en hacerlo. Tanto la trama principal, de Kim Shin y Eun Tak, como la secundaria, de “El ángel de la muerte”, son conmovedoras y muy románticas. Si bien es verdad, esta última no tiene muchos momentos felices, pero aún así es fabulosa. Y no me enrollo más, si quieres tener una experiencia feliz viendo un dorama, este es un magnífico título. Risas, romance, llanto. Todo ello, llevado de una manera magistral para que no puedas quitar ojo de la pantalla. Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

In questo caso non è successo grazie alla bravura degli attori mi ha tenuta incollata allo schermo. La musica poi è spettacolare, mi sono ritrovata a canticchiarla al lavoro, mentre ero a fare la spesa, il bucato, etc. La malinconia che pervade  me la sono portata dietro per diverso tempo. Ho anche riso tanto, ma ho anche pianto. Unicissima pecca di tutta questa meraviglia?Il finale.Mamma mia quanto i coreani sono in grado di rovinare un'opera perfetta con poche e semplici scene. Purtroppo abbiamo anche quesiti che rimangono aperti, domande a cui nessuno può rispondere perchè sono senza senso. Non posso cmq non consigliarlo, perchè se non fosse stato per quelle due cosette sul finale questa serie da me avrebbe ottenuto un 10 pieno.

Empecemos por el Goblin y su novia. Desde el primer momento que se ven, es hermoso. La confusión de porqué ella podía seguirlo a todos lados, porqué no veía la espada y porqué podía invocarlo. La negación de él a que fuese su novia al verla tan joven. Luego está La Parca y el Goblin, cuando comienzan a pelear entre ellos, a discutir, a beber juntos. A poner el clima pesado, jajaja. Ninguno de los dos tiene suerte en el amor al principio, uno está peor que otro. Sunny y La Parca, asdf, cada vez que él trata de manejar el teléfono, las indirectas que ella le manda, sus respuestas honesta y su dolor de cabeza por no saber su nombre. Ellos me derritieron. En serio, fue todo tan hermoso. Y no paras de reír en ningún momento. :3 Hasta los personajes secundarios fueron geniales. Ese final me hizo llorar mares, de verdad rompió mi corazón. Me alegra saber que ella fue ese tipo de persona, capaz de dar su vida por muchos. Pero verlo a él entregado a las lágrimas, sintiendo la pérdida por tantos años... asdf. No podía dejar de llorar, tampoco cuando la Parca llora por Sunny que se escucha en la cocina. ""Ésta vez yo vendré a usted"".Pese a que fue triste, se me hizo un final hermoso.

Como tudo se desenrola, você sempre espera o próximo capítulo e não consegue parar de assistir. O ponto alto , pra mim, foi a interação que surgiu entre o ceifador e o goblin.

Assim como aconteceu com Pousando no Amor, me arrependo de não ter assistido antes. O que me fez não ter interesse de assisti-lo de cara, foram 3 coisas:A primeira foi minha amiga ter dito q começou a assistir e não gostou (ela é muito influente na minha vida, fazer o quê rsrsrs). A segunda foi não ter na Netflix, porque vamos admitir, é muito bom não ter que ficar se levantando pra pular anúncio e mudar de episódio toda vida que ele acaba. E a terceira, foi os dois atores principais, porque antes de assistir eu admito que achava o Gong Yoo feio (agora eu estou aqui me perguntando o que aconteceu kkkkkkk, porque ôô HOMEM LINDO,  MARAVILHOSO E FOFO <3), e a Kim Go Eun, eu não gostava dela, porque não fui muito com Cheese in the Trap, que foi o único drama que assisti com ela ( Mas ela me conquistou em Goblin, aaaa eu sou muito influenciável!). O primeiro episódio, irei admitir que é um pouco cansativo, porque conta a história toda e tals; mas depois é só sucessoo!! Os personagens, o enredo, a atuação, a química entre o casal, e a trilha sonora são perfeitíssimas! Amei todo o elenco! Outro ator que me conquistou foi o Lee Dong Wook, mesmo caso anterior, não fui muito com Tale of the Nine-Tailed, e por isso não gostava muito dele, mas depois de Goblin, entrou pra minha lista de Oppas com certeza! As coisas que eu senti falta foram só as cenas entre o casal secundário. Mas de resto, maravilhoso! Super indico!Concluído por mim: 27/04/21  Read More  Was this review helpful to you?

Choro e mais choro!Eu comecei assistir dramas a pouco tempo e sempre ouvi as pessoas da dramaland falando de Goblin, e como o drama é bom e emocionante. Resolvi assistir e comprovei que tudo que falaram era a mais pura verdade, uma historia incrível, que nos toca e que nos faz sentir a dor dos personagens como se nós estivessemos vivendo aquilo.Sorri em vários momentos e chorei em muitos também, como nunca tinha chorado por um drama. Terminei e fiquei com a sensação de vazio, pretendo revê-lo um dia, mas só daqui um bom tempo quando eu já tiver me recuperado dessa dose hahaFalando do romance dos personagens, a história do Ceifador e da Sunny acabou comigo, chorei horrores! Queria que eles tivessem vivido mais momentos felizes durante o drama, aquele momento que eles sobem as escadas pro paraíso juntos, nossa, eu desmoronei! Ela disse que ele não teria mais notícias dela, mas no fim, ele teve de um jeito ou de outro.A morte da Euntak também foi um baque pra mim, mas ela estava tão serena, sabia que havia chegado a hora e cumpriu a promessa de voltar para o Goblin no final.Agora sobre o final, eu gostei bastante, mas fiquei triste com o fato de que não tivemos os 4 juntos nas suas novas vidas, o Ceifador, a Sunny, a Euntak e o Goblin, sei que eles ficaram felizes, mas queria vê-los juntos de novo nessa nova jornada.Não posso finalizar sem falar da OST incrivel do drama, que deu um toque a mais de emoção em cada episódio. Um trabalho incrível!Enfim, só tenho elogios para esse drama maravilhoso!  Read More  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel (Full Review Not Available)"

Reconozco que la vi porque muchos compararon The King con esta serie ya que es la misma escritora,  y si, tiene cosas parecidas, que entiendo porque comparan, perooo no tiene nada que ver la historia, asumo que de ahora en adelante veré mas historia de esta señora, ya que me encanta lo que escribe, jajaja. Aunque Herederos no me gustó, no todo es perfecto. Creo que ella mejora con el tiempo.Ahora hablare de Gong Yoo, es la primera vez que lo veo actuar, y caí rendida ante su actuación, ante su sonrisa, ante sus ojos, la verdad ese hombre tiene algo profundo, sumado a este personaje tan interesante, realmente te enamoras. Le crees todo lo que expresa, por eso este personaje es tan especial ya que él lo hace especial. Y bueno, después lo juntas con Lee Dong Wook y te ríes a carcajadas. Que buena pareja hacen estos dos. Kim Go Eun, me encanta ella, si dude por un segundo con su papel en The King, este otro me termino de confirmar que es buena, los actuó muy diferente, cuando sonreía como una niña picara, me decía a mi misma, Ella es la misma de The King? Dos personas totalmente opuestas. Me gustaron todos los personajes, me gusta cómo lograban mostrando poco, darle profundidad a cada uno. Aunque el personaje de que me costo entender fue Sunny, al final quede totalmente conmovida con su linda historia de amor. No quiero contar spoiler, ya que me costaría mucho hacerlo y que pudieran entenderlo bien, ya que por la forma que esta contada, es muy interesante y difícil de armarlo yo solita. Por eso me gustó mucho y seguro la voy a volver a ver. Una historia compleja, con tantos giros inesperados. Pasando del drama a la comedia, llorar y al rato estar muerto de risa. Te involucras tanto que es como si fueras parte de la familia. Casi que juras que tienes una habitación en esa preciosa casa donde viven.

Goblin był tutaj bardzo dobrze poprowadzony aczkolwiek nie zawsze wykazywał się empatią. Postacią ktora przyciągnęła moją największą uwagę był natomiast Reaper grany przez Wookiego i śmiało można powiedzieć, że była to najbardziej przemyślana i najlepiej zagrana persona w całym seansie. Było pare ponaciaganych wątków tj. powrót Euntak w tym samym ciele, sam fakt tego że Goblin powrócił i nie zostało to zbytnio zargumentowane. Muzyka była natomiast świetna, jednym z najpiękniejszych dla mnie utworów było Stuck in Love Kim Kyunghee. Wspaniała gra aktorska jak i liczne metafory były ukazane w sposób majestatyczny i nieoczywisty który bardzo skłaniał do refleksji i dawał dużo do myślenia. Jednymi słowy ten ciepły, rodzinny zimowy klimat był zachecajacy i pozwalał utożsamić się z bohaterami seansu.

Yo soy una de esas personas a las que les cuesta mucho empezar con un drama porque piensa que no le va a gustar, que se le va a hacer largo, etc. Con Goblin me pasó exactamente eso, que no me decidía nunca a empezarlo pero, cuando lo he hecho, no me he arrepentido, para nada.Con este drama, me he reído lo que no está escrito, así como he llorado a lágrima viva en muchos momentos. Estos cambios dentro de un mismo capítulo me han parecido geniales. Creo que no he reído y llorado tanto en un drama como con este. La relación entre el Goblin y la Parca es asombrosa. Tienen una química increíble, hasta el punto de que, en muchas ocasiones, parecen ellos los protagonistas principales. Es con esta pareja con la que más me he reído, aunque no ha sido la única.La historia de fantasía que nos cuenta el drama es, para mí, maravillosa. Además, los efectos especiales que la acompañan son muy buenos, haciendo que te metas más y más en la historia.La historia en sí no es demasiado complicada, es muy sencilla de entender, aunque tiene más giros que una peonza. Estos giros a mí me han gustado muy mucho. No hay un solo episodio en el que las sorpresas me hayan defraudado. Sobre la banda sonora... Es que es el complemento perfecto a un drama maravilloso. Las canciones están muy bien elegidas y ayudan mucho al desarrollo de la trama. Por no hablar de la música de fondo. Sin duda alguna, la canción de ""Amnesia"" ha sido una maravilla para mis oídos, así como el ""Eun Tak's Waltz"", que también se lleva una parte de mi corazón.Por lo que respecta a los actores... Soberbios, espectaculares, magníficos. No ha habido un solo momento en el que no me haya creído la historia que me estaban contando. Y no sólo de parte de los personajes principales, sino también de los actores secundarios, que han dado la talla en todo momento. La química entre los protagonistas principales y los secundarios ha sido espectacular. En cuanto a los cabos sueltos de la historia... Es cierto que tiene algún cabo suelto, pero está tan bien llevada la serie que, para nada, me han importado esos cabos sueltos. Me hubiese gustado ver algo más sobre Duk-Hwa y la representante escolar (amiga de Eun Tak), o qué sucede con los primos de Eun Tak. Pero todo esto no impide que la serie me haya maravillado.Por último, comentar el vestuario. Madre mía qué ropas me llevaba Sunny... Ojalá las pudiese llevar yo misma. Y nada que objetar con los abrigos de la Parca y del Goblin. Si estás dudando, no lo hagáis. La historia te atrapa y no te defrauda. Eso sí, tened a mano pañuelos porque los vais a necesitar, eso tenedlo por seguro. Dadle una oportunidad, que siempre estás a tiempo de dejar de verla si no os gusta.

Porém, me esforcei a continuar assistindo e foi a melhor decisão que eu poderia ter tomado.O casal principal evolui de uma maneira sutil e quando eu menos esperava estava completamente apaixonada pelos dois e não só por eles mas por todos os personagens e, principalmente, pela história. Eu me envolvi com com o drama sem nem perceber, passei a sofrer e a rir junto  com os personagens e ansiar profundamente pelo tão esperado final feliz. Os últimos episódios são incríveis e prenderam completamente minha atenção de um modo que nem eu esperava.Goblin me fez experimentar um misto de emoções tão grande, minha opinião sobre o show mudou varias vezes enquanto assistia e quando terminou eu demorei a digerir o que eu havia acabado de assistir, não sabia o que pensar, eu amei, odiei ou foi mais um drama qualquer?O drama não é nada obvio e não entrega nada de mão beijada, tem que se permitir mergulhar na história pra assim ser capaz de desfrutar tudo que ela tem a oferecer.Penso que se desde o primeiro momento eu tivesse comprado o show minha experiência teria sido ainda melhor (claro que os flashbacks repetitivos e as cenas desnecessárias acabam atrapalhando um pouco).Raramente desejo por uma segunda temporada de um dorama, mas goblin eu realmente ficaria muito feliz se tivesse.P.S: O ceifador e Sunny são um dos melhores casais secundários no mundo dos dramas.

Talvez você esteja se perguntando, “se esse é seu dorama favorito, por que não deu nota dez para ele”? Bem, máquinas são perfeitas. Deuses são perfeitos. Mas essa história não foi escrita por uma máquina ou por um deus, mas sim por humanos para outros humanos. Eu até diria que se Goblin fosse perfeito ele não seria tão bom quanto é, pois sem seus pequenos defeitos ele nunca seria capaz de despertar tantas emoções e sentimentos nas pessoas. Enfim, eu vou fazer a avaliação que eu sempre faço em todos os doramas com os cinco pontos principais que eu analiso em um uma obra, entretanto eu recomendo fortemente que você assista Goblin sem nenhum preceito e tire suas próprias conclusões, afinal, assim como a morte, a vida é algo totalmente imprevisível.    • História (8,5/10): Confusa no início, mas toma impulso e torna-se mais envolvente com o passar do tempo. É um belo e melancólico romance com uma resolução bem trabalhada.    • Visual (10/10): Cenários memoráveis, paisagens brilhantes de tirar o fôlego e uma direção que proveu diversas cenas apaixonantes. Ótimos efeitos especiais.    • Som (9/10): Apesar de não gostar de “Hush” e “Beautiful” (e, infelizmente, essa última canção é tocada muitas vezes no drama), Goblin tem uma trilha sonora marcante e que é usada magistralmente para transmitir os sentimentos dos personagens. “Amnesia” é provavelmente o maior exemplo disso e uma verdadeira obra-prima.    • Personagens (8,5/10): É impossível não se emocionar com a história dos personagens principais. Além de esbanjarem carisma, evoluíram significantemente durante a trama, sem perder sua essência ou características próprias. Claro que em algumas ocasiões a falta de comunicação pode irritar um pouco, mas, se você conseguir aguentar isso, será recompensado com um relacionamento adorável entre um casal com muita química (e um bromance maravilhoso).    • Entretenimento (9,5/10): Rendeu-me algumas risadas e (muitas) lágrimas. Mesmo sendo uma obra relativamente lenta, não é entediante. Pelo contrário, são os momentos mais simples e casuais que realmente imersam o telespectador na obra.
